Could they win it all?  Maybe.But for all those fans of teams with bad spring records, remember EarlWeaver's first law of baseball (From his book on managing)No one gives a damn in July if you lost a game in March. :)BTW, anyone have any idea on the contenders for the O's fifth starter?It's pretty much set that Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald and Rhodes are thefirst four in the rotation.Here at Johns Hopkins University where the mascot is the Blue Jay :(,their baseball team logo was the Toronto club's logo. Now it's a anatomically correct blue jay. God, can't they think of an original idea?It's even in the same pose as the baltimore oriole on the O's hats.How many people realize that the bird is really called a baltimore oriole?__________________________________________________________________________|Admiral Steve C.

In fact,>it doesn't mean *anything*, because the units are screwy.I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will resultin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I wouldrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% ineach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winningby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obviouspositive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus,before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study mustgo into what sort of relationship there is.>Consider an example:  Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first;>about .12 on your scale.  He does the same thing again in the fourth, with>the score tied, for another .14.  And again, in the seventh, with the score>tied, for another .22.  And, finally, in the ninth to win the game by a score>of 7-6, for a value of 0.5.  Bob hit 4 solo HR in 4 plate appearances, and>was credited by your method with .12 + .14 + .22 + .5 = .98.  But what does>that mean?  Was Bob 98% responsible for the win?  Certainly not; the defense>is *always* 50% responsible (if you include pitching in that), and Bob wasn't>pitching.  In fact, Bob was only 4/7 of the offense (which is a lot, but not>even close to 100%).  Furthermore, what about the other 3 team runs?  Say>they all came on solo HR by Fred; then Fred was hitting HR to tie up the game,>which are just as valuable as HR to take the lead (see Lindsey), and Fred will>himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so.  So Fred and Bob combined have>amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME.  There's clearly a problem here.The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactlyhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over manyseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some playersperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is aplayer who gets an out gets a "negative probability" in most cases.Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbersfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have giventhem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter thatpulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  >>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the>>mark.  Closers are enormously important.  The total number of runs>>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming.>>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough.>>In another article, I proposed a test of this.  We can predict a team's >won/lost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs *total* they>score and allow, without regard to when those runs score in the game.  If>late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at>late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right?No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I wouldthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inningwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usuallycomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to arguethat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importanceto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runsoften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starterwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  Theoffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am notsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  IfI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how manyruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       >Here's another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball.  What>you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost>exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play.>Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with>no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who >scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero.>>Does this make sense?No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning wouldbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly highprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of theball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a "negative chance" that the teamwould win. From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that thosewho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it reallydoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain playersin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performancegoes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that exceptfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association toplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if youdo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out whatthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find forinstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was justas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have theexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's,etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitchedin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was morevaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better pitcher?  They were probably about the same.                                                        Brian Smith

Bleacher seats are almostgone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O'scould sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division formost of the year like '89). On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to beforced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get anowner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitchingstaff looks pretty good.

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader."What could be better," declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubsare challenging?     "It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked," announcedRyne Sandberg.  "If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, orBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able towin.     "Lord, I hope we pull it off."     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, PeteRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cutthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threwto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose tothird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let himbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks thisyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into agap in right-center.  "Cool Papa" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball offand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boonegrounded out to second, ending the threat.       "Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt orTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure onKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spellsRose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able tosustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times."  So came theanalysis from Frank Chance.     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' groundermoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singledhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Kleinsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen poppedout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hittingfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded intoa 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring astrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quickTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced apop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  TheCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To getanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlockplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpenwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead againstLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, drivinghome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler addedanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpenhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 moreruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at onepoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, offRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, butthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  BruceSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in theeighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and wouldconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.-------------------------------------------------------------------     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among theall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their firstfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out offirst in this wacky season.     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled SteveRogers 3-2.  "We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of ourteam speed," remarked Lou Brock.  "I don't see why we can't win thisdivision."     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds ofthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.-------------------------------------------------------------------     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,now 2 back - but in 4th!    "When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in apitcher's park like this," spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  KeithHernandez added that "their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins."  The Pirates have made only26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tendto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshoneSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  WhenNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, thePirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  BertBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessedfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on homeruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by RalphKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in thetop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after MookieWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner onfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with KentTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds inleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcingStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing thePirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulveallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the rightfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who enteredto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deepcenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-parkhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.------------------------------------------------------------------     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):     Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giantsmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some startingpitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this comingweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while."     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette andthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschelfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homerhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and DonBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott hadone each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday'sdoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of theNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win afterretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, butfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in thefirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as theBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell tothree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.-------------------------------------------------------------------     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced EwellBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rathergood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, thetrade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Ofcourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in theoutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched twohome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and RayNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled SatchelPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game wasscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was workinghis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out andJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled theGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highlyemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.-------------------------------------------------------------------     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in thewide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill inthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  "Normally," Drysdale remarked, "Iwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't affordto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can'tafford to let the Astros beat us."  He then winked and said: "Well, maybeDavis will get decked once."     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) isprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that hiscurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team isa little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo isthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threwtwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware ofthe nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall allaround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  Thefoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,with center field at 420 feet.  "It's as if some three-year-old threw atantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hithome runs'," remarked Roy Campanella.     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalizethe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via theBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded witha two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and theAstros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth toerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatenedto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.     "I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop," he explained.     "How can we do that," Pee Wee Reese wondered.     "They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready tothrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but Iwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go witha shallow infield almost the whole time."     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eightinnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doranpushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second andthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  TheDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as NolanRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  FernandoValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.     "We're mostly a power team," remarked Ron Cey.  "Jackie and, when heplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple otherplays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  Iguess that's why they're so successful there."  Indeed, it seems thatbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Strosswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

I predicted it amonglarge guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  Ithink it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainlymore reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and havereleased one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  Itmay also be logical.  I don't know what ethics have to do with it.Seems like pretty good common sense to me.--The Beastmaster-- Mark Singer    mss@netcom.com

Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who "hasn't matured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year-old who is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young, and have looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim Deshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies hasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has gone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven. I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.>>2.  Who is playing short and third?Well, Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year, but was a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is split (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry Jorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 years.  I'm not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be happy with what they have here.  I like Jorgenson, but I fear they might give too much time to Pags. >3.

His equivalentaverage started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. Solet us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 levelof play.That is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the topten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was DaveWinfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds,an incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is betterthan any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about whatMattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years;just ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than RyanKlesko's MLEs. He got more attention from the media than was warranted from hisbaseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. Themedia would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was agood, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th besthitter in the majors.Clay D.

I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcherdefense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove fromyour viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at isopponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.   As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another bigbat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is thatthey're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliardplays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one ofMel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-richJays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have. I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.  -- Dave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch      Blue Jays - Do it again in '93 kirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu                        New .. quotes out of context!"Not to beat a dead horse, but it's been a couple o' weeks .. this  disappoints me..punishments..discharges..jackhammering.." - Stephen Lawrence

Basically, they looked at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time theywere 24, and noticed some interesting things.   For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs inthe history of the game. They also found out such players represented themajority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was thatthey actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careerslasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also  found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance andproduced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players.

Iremember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss myguess he was wearing the exact same duds.  The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) havereinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Metsinsgnia on the front of the jersey.  To my knowledge it is thefirst time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds mea little of the Dodger logo.  Many teams have opted for a return to a previous styleof uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional.(Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the oncebright colors have been altered to gray.  The trend has alsoseen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of theearly years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiumsconstrucrted throughout the sixties.With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no onein the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on thehorizon, it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like itwas meant to be.

It appears that ina neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses twohome runs).  Or do they?  What is "equivalent average?"One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC tookaway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go fordoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter youexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect hisvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  > That is good. Very good, in fact.

Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought hewas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so at baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn'twinning.Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is amistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past majorand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recentthe player has left college ball, etc.Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of "error."  Sometimesa player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (OddibeMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there arereal reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and liftingand so on.But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common backgroundof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players isthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playingball.  Their backgrounds are similar.What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a playerwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that aBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or soon, has such a different background, that the standard model and standardassumptions fit this person slowly?It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, afterall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continuallymake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton."Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers," they say.  Well,what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston thanTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year inAtlanta than Greenville.  Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tankthis year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's worse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.It's got some error.Oh well.Bill Guilfordstill thinks "hairy butt is truly ugly" might be right

Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs7.  California Angels - will win no gamesNL East1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a "team"5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doingNL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 24.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 19935.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.NLCS  Montreal d.

He hit that well last year (afteradjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on anabsolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between theminors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don'tbelieve there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old goodseason than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellentseason?

Getready for him to have a monster year. He is now hitting the ball tothe opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural power to right field and his good batting eye. If he stays healthywhich he should (his back is full strength this year) he shouldget over 100 RBI and close to 30 HR.In another note, the Marlins got off to a good start beating theDodgers. I believe the score was 6 - 3 but I'm not sure. I wishthem and the Rockies well this year. Hell. I think it would befunny to watch the Dodgers hit the cellar again this year.Dan Smith

(I don't remember a 30-day, but rather a 21-day.  Anyways, it's gone now.)  The period length is a minimum, not a maximum.  You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long as you want, IF he's still certified as injured.  The player must be periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.  When there was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between the lists.--King "Sparky" Banaian|"No taxes:  No new taxes,kbanaian@pitzer.claremont.edu|no old taxes, we are taxedDept. of Economics, Pitzer College|enough." -- Rep.

Olson was stillrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),and there were questions as to whether he would beable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopezcan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he wasthe Braves "Defensive Catcher" prospect, while Brian Deak wasthe Braves "Offensive Catcher" prospect.  Besides, Olsonand Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboardbox, and don't walk enough to be useful.But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves wentwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been downat the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear andtear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying tomove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.Plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn'ttiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhillat $450,000, but that's only what I recall).3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role toplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year playersaren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the rosterthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,but the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a businessstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/thefirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,which, IMO, includes Lopez.Of course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it wentlike this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)Cox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be alittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fieldingis better than it used to be.Schuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deionjust won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't counton him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for thedefense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up onBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought togive us some pitching depth in 1995.Cox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.OK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts havingBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what aboutKlesko?Schuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 milfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the moneyor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  FirstJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If hegets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that heand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!Cox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the tradingdeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a fewextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.And if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's kneescould be "persuaded" to act up.  There's always the15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!Schuerholz:  What about Caraballo?Cox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he startsin Richmond, he'll start walking more.

Sci.Lines: 74I've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predictthe Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how?First Base:Grace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of CecilFielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations,then even, otherwise, edge to CubsSecond Base:Sandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edgeto Cubs...a big edge.Shortstop:Vizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is anautomatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.Third Base:Dave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter.Buechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge toFlorida.Catcher: Santiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge toMarlinsLeft Field:Conine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential.I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proveshimself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is positionwhere Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.Center:Scott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully theCubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. Mayisn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he playsfull time.Right:Felix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So doesSosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to CubsStarters:Aquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won'tremind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbardis average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to CubsMiddle Relief:Even. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins.Carpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.Closer:A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, butno Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save.Look for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (witha better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.Overall, an edge to Chicago.Neither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course.e--msilverm@nyx.cs.du.eduGO CUBS!!!"One likes to believe in the freedom of baseball" - Geddy Lee

From: drw3l@delmarva.evsc.Virginia.EDU (David Robert Walker)Subject: Re: Young CatchersOrganization: University of VirginiaLines: 70Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate,with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times.My opinion, FWIW, to all:Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untriedrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has provenhimself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he playsbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decentminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and LasVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average majorleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago'snumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't havethe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least tostart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor leagueseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, verypoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhillare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs onthe Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year wasjust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year atany level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted, I thought his behavior withMcCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first timehe ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But hehas a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is morevaluable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24),had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor,EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF(which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least thepotential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reachinghis "prime" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimateprospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

Any reason given for this?Also, I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline inthe preview. On 8/22/89, Rickey Henderson became Nolan's 5000th strikeout.On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe thelast out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolanpitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot ofpublicity at Rickey's expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems asmost of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately. They areboth great players, but IMO, Nolan has outclassed Rickey, both in playingand more importantly, in attitude. Just my thoughts.Kevin

I'm serious; Itend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, butI'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there areany.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I canlook up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish betweenplayers who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numberswould have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, butactually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was "rushed", althoughthere doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell wasgiven 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below whatyou would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs thenext year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, atage 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where hewould have been better off staying in the minor league (where he wasperformed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being "rushed";Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might havebeen less likely to give up on him.Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  Butdoes that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and startsperforming up to expectations?Sherri Nicholssnichols@adobe.com

I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues.The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as theyhad little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example,was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign.His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookieyear.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle soand then rebound.Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) hadgood numbers immediately.I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, andDerek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came upthat they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but itdidn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.

Both theSDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher'sdefense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about howimportant calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking ballsin the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how variouscatcher's rank in "defense".  Looking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspectthat he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as Ican tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blockingthe ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs toclear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitionsat AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  All we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  andBerryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helpingthe pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almostall veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learnthe major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going tolearn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn'tbe supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen overpitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.Now, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major leaguepitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaringproblem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that hecan't learn just as well while in the majors?

He was then (I think) leftoff the playoff roster, and started the next year in the minors whereeven the Braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so madat going back down. he struggled last year, no doubt, but even the Braves blamed part of iton the demotion.

EastSummary: The division has gone to the birdsKeywords: last chance for foolishnessArticle-I.D.: pegasus.steph.733989466Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, ILLines: 95Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies andpredictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worsefinishes in last year's prediction contest.AL East -- 19931.  Baltimore OriolesWhy the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down tothis:  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.  -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees  -- Milwaukee was a fluke  -- Indians aren't ready to contend  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better  -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of "replacement level""But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you."  No.  As a matterof fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either divisionon paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  "You don't really think that BradyAnderson is going to repeat, do you?"  No.  I'm basing the Orioles predictionon the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  "GlennDavis?  That's insane".  Yes.  So, without further ado:STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.ObPrediction:  "The Streak" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in  caught stealing.2. New York Yankees.STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner   factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to  win a division.WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.ObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.3.  Toronto Blue JaysSTRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.  Guzman.  Alomar.WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in AugustWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And  have a losing record.4.  Milwaukee BrewersSTRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up.WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.WOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year.ObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.5.  Cleveland IndiansSTRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, NagyWEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix  Fermin.WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.6.  Boston Red SoxSTRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, ClemensWEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DLObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how  you will :->7.  Detroit TigersSTRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, WhitakerWEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.  Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.  This year could be *very* ugly.WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP.WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP.ObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.One more division to go....-- Dale J.

First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summeratmosphere in early spring for baseball.  In comparison Wrigley Fieldin early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy andbundled up fans.  The second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys/gals!I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball.It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed tothe Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was theAFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it,but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking witha lot of baseball fans in other cities.  Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansionteams bring back some excitement.  We'll find out Friday how DenverBronco fans respond. Phillies are 2-0!

It was also his career high48th. Another home run that I thought was totally incredible was in the1986 ALCS.  The CA Angles had the Boston Red Sox *1* strike away fromthe pennant until Don Baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run.That was the most incredible turn of events I have EVER seen inbaseball.  The Sox later took the pennant away only to have the samething done to them in the WS against the Mets.

Enough with the cliches.My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up totheir potential, they won't need much offensive support.I realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust.There is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three otherpitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their firstor second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take themound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most runs wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore theiropponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows thatyou do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.All I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitcherslike the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong.Sam> > -Dave> > >>Sherri Nichols>>snichols@adobe.com >

He'sgot Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter - coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.  It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin was there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.  BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the replay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a serious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.>>I can't take this anymore>Well, I'm still hanging in there.GO REDBIRDS!!

He is just a right hander who stuck around for a long timeand could throw hard.  Very few 20 game winning seasons, lots oflosing seasons, lots of walks.  No Cy Young awards.  How does NolanRyan compare to a guy like Steve Carlton who dominated 5 or 6 MajorLeague seasons, won 7 divisons, 2 World Series, and won half of histeams games in 1972?  He doesn't compare.  Not even close.Kirby Puckett hasn't done it long enough for me.  Give me 5 moreseasons like he's been having, then I'll think about it.

But thepitcher is 80% of the defense.  The primary role of every other playeris on offense.  Even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensivegame than of the defensive game.  (They might not do much with theirpart of the offense, but that's another issue.)That being said, I think both Smith and Yount deserve the HOF.  Theyhit pretty well in addition to their defense.Cheers,-Valentine

If it is, I wouldn't give the book,or anything in it any value whatsoever.  Klapisch wrote thebook to make money (obviously) and sensational literature isgoing to sell a lot better than what he usually writes for thepapers.  I'm not calling him a liar, but if there was any proofthat a Met player had raped a little girl before a game (letalone doing it on a regular basis) they would be in jail, notShea.For those people who do not know what the press is likein New York, it is probably more cut-throat than in just aboutany other part of the U.S.  Keith Hernandez said it very well onESPN a couple of days ago, they would much rather mention aclubhouse fight, than a two-run homer in the ninth to win agame.  I do not read Klapisch's news columns regularly, but Ido know that he has been accused before as being an instigatorthat enjoys (hopefully for only professional reasons) to drumbup a news story, even if there isn't one there.  Now as far asthe confrontation with Bobby Bonilla a few days ago, I almosttotally blame Bonilla.  No matter what a member of the pressdoes, and no matter how much of a putrid individual he mightbe, that does not give a ballplayer the right to threaten ajournalist.  Personally, I always thought that a beat writer thatalways follows a club around should report the news, but not belooking to degrade a team.  I don't know whether to blameKlapisch, because that may be the only way to keep a job in NewYork.

(No offense,> Gordon).I wouldn't give baserunning that much value.The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  IfOlerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs anextra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to holdat third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value thanAlomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting adouble.)Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is thatthe runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  Noteam in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster playersthan others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as wellin the 1950's for all teams.  Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used HarmonKillebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with38 times caught stealing.  Yet they scored slightly more runs thanpredicted by Runs Created.--David Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu"We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary.""Please rotate your phone 90 degrees and try again."Disclaimer: I speak for no one and no one speaks for me.

From: steph@pegasus.cs.uiuc.edu (Dale Stephenson)Subject: Hits Stolen -- Second Base 1992Summary: Stolen Hits for all second basemenKeywords: second defenseOrganization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, ILLines: 117Disclaimer -- This is for fun.In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called"stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would notmake with average effort."  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages postedby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive statsfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays KurtStillwell would not have made."OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If wereplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% outmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated NetHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a leagueaverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net DoublePlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, orDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), whichshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don'ttake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of thisarticle.The short version -- definition of termsHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt StillwellNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielderNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielderNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielderDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.National Leaguename            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPSAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865Sandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015Thompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852Lind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571Doran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705DeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755Harris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602Lemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573Morandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580Randolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582Biggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656Stillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336Ordered by DOPS1.015 Sandberg .865 Alicea .852 Thompson .755 DeShields .705 Doran .678 *NL Average* .656 Biggio .602 Harris .582 Randolph .580 Morandini .573 Lemke .571 Lind .336 StillwellAmerican League---------------name            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPSFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811Reed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708Ripken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631Baerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838Blankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757Miller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725Alomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812Knoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718Bordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704Kelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636Whitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806Reynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603Sax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555Sojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602Order by DOPS.838 Baerga.812 Alomar.811 Fletcher.806 Whitaker.757 Blankenship.725 Miller.718 Knoblauch.708 Reed.704 Bordick.691 *AL Average*.636 Kelly.631 Ripken.603 Reynolds.602 Sojo.555 SaxMore discussion --DCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)Why such a bizzare formula?

Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started with a solid single to right, moved to second on "Bob" Kelly's infield sneakerdown the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off doubleby Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla afterJoe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by "drawing the line" (really, heshould know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up gettingtossed.The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent'ssingle, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchelland turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Bransonfailed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infieldto discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.(Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin'sground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-backsingles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a longfly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, butthird base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself washung out to dry killing the Reds rally.Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runneron second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday gamein late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss onDibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla endedup walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win wentto Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect inningswork, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bitsurprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victorytoday.

True,Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, withlots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereasJeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.     That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superbpitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of achance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but nopitching.  At least, to me.     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a teamwith Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no realorder, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, butwith a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better byseasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time intheir best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking allthe players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And allthe offense would have to do is get 1 run across.     I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all-time teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the resultsI would love to see that.-- Doug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: "Mommys and Daddys & other    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & lovemissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, 'cause Heaven is just a greathe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!"

From: kkeach@pomona.claremont.eduSubject: three homer games and Padres notesReply-To: kkeach@pomona.claremont.eduOrganization: Pomona CollegeLines: 36To all those out there wondering about who holds the record for threehomer games ina career, the answer is Johnny Mize in his career with the Cards and the Yanks.  He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. Incase anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by BabeRuth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of JuanGonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that he had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any recordbooks at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I am wrong.  Onto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and Ican't get McPaper consistently around here.  comment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two dealsthat brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could hit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finishwith .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  leadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm lucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 stealsalready.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  Ihaven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are goingto use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and thisyear is stealing bases.Sheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.Witness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,or anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don't hear anything.Andy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91?   or is this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?

From: Mamatha Devineni Ratnam <mr47+@andrew.cmu.edu>Subject: Zane!!Rescue us from Simmons!!Organization: Post Office, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PALines: 77NNTP-Posting-Host: andrew.cmu.eduSo far Simmons looks like a total idiot.1) Zane Smith should learn how to "switchpitch" and return from the DL. Iwould rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had animpressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon'sreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had theAL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope hepitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they haveshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a littlebit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration atthe plate in his rookie year.4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think thatWalk desrved his contract.5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. Ican't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince throughwaivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving himway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaughtshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handedpitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt totrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAllierewasn't very fit last year.6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of theseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Otherthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to havepitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the moneyon Patterson in stead.8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw hisvalue has increased immensely.11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is betterthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreementin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing thatidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. TheRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replacetwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made avery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would havea respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hitleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have optionsfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure wasgetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,nothing else will.On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest ofthe season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of theseason, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peakedin the second half of the last 2 seasons)>-Pravin Ratnam

As Roger Lustig pointed out in aprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball wasbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner ona constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time. If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be adifferent story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have tohire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who isan admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Metsgame at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended frombaseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,that's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you startsuspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single timeunder whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remainingto play a three-on-three game.

It was the Phils only win in the three game series, andwas the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the youngseason.   The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However DannyJackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead.Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4,however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  Inthe 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the yearto push the Phils ahead to stay.  However, in a shaky bottom of the11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base whenthe Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out ofposition players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end thegame.The Phils bring their league leading 9-3 record back to actionTuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday against the Padres.

I just don't understand why people insiston lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium).Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will havethe platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teamsmay be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probablyonly a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their startersfor this reason during the regular season.I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless ofwhether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to havehigher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managersgo out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because ofthe platoon advantage).Am I missing something here?--Craig

I see no reason why theyshouldn't win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles andthe Tigers *still* have no pitching.

So far, no takers.Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and hehas also led the team in past years for hitting into doubleplays, or at least been among the leaders. Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to playevery day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played justone base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively. Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed.The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having aneffect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinezwere bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that mighthave seen him lifted in the third in past years. Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more ballsin the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been greaton defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying tosteal and has at least one pick off at first. Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement ondefense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgerssome runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average.I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Strawseem to have come out of theirs. Dodger

He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs  many times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300  while knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's  slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that  dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was  one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit  the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new  Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence  since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his  hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds  of last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an  uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,  and my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George  inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the  Yankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?  For 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5  million this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play  the field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should  give the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age  of Yankee domination.Michael Lurie

Or Darrell>Evans! Yeah, yeah! After the Hall of Fame takes in them, it can take in>Eddie Murray and Jeff Reardon.Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, hadnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decenthitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman aresimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, hisOBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)was a absolute-primo-dick.  Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know thatMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of theMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a ssolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda likeTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.>     Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody>giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,>marginal.Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?>Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both>shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.>Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so>liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if somethingNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED theposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something alongthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's morerecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie'soffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of hiscareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a realstiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far asSS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.>isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When >certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential >candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a "mediot" candidate, pushed because of his "winning attitude" (a minor factor, if oneat all), and his "great defense" (no errors, admittedly, but the range ofa tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the lastyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talkabout Morris' "ability to win" which is nothing more than Morris' "abilityto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs".  At this point, Morris is anaverage pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great yearfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, butnot favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF"consideration".  Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone willthrow back your earlier logic about "Yount and Smith being shortstops who hung around a long time".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a fewmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, mostlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty muchregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, andlegitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined theleague.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in theend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an offthe top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probablyleft a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

I mean, all the Braves have done is gone to two consecutiveworld series.  Also, being the Cubs fan that I am, I really have to hand it toall the Braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with thatinfernal cheer that they have.  However, I do have to protest anyone saying that all Cubs fans are stupid.  Theway I see it, either I'm just too stupid to acknowledge it, or that observationwas just plain wrong.  You might have us confused with Bear fans. ;)Anyway, about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the Cubswould finish up last in their division.  (Even behind Florida?!?  Sheesh!)  These same people were predicting the Braves to clean up in their respectivedivision.  Well,  we're ten games into the season and these people are a littleless vocal now.  I wonder why.Well, the way I see it, the East is up for grabs, and whoever wants it most isgoing to take it, with the exception of Florida.  Every team seems to havegood batting and pitching, with Philly presently leading the pack.  But, I justhave to point out, if the Cubs do take the East, they'll do it without thebenefit of a competent manager.  However, and it pains me to say it, thepennant is going to go to the West.Just had to get that off my chest.Docbembenefit of a compee

And enlightening.Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,circa June 1986.1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,    not gain more bulk.2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard    to make adjustments in your swing.What would I do, if I were Jose?Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, thiswill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to movethe bathead more freely.Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can findmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rollingthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out ofthe park.If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his backproblems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he couldstill hit 600+ HR.-- *   Gary Huckabay   * "You think that's loud enough, a$$hole?"           **   "Movie Rights   * "Well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir,   **   available thru  *  I'd be happy to turn it up for you.

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five inthe 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitchedseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took partin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado haspitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next loweston the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, whileThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The nextbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the teamis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/gameand giving up 6.6/game. Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense shouldcome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gavethe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to besuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief eitherheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpenis a big question mark.In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while WilliamSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's gamewith California was cancelled.--salty

Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the7th for the other Tiger run.John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lastingthrough the seventh inning.

It might be that pre-backproblems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stancecaused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurtshim.

He changes his stance so much, he losestrack of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good tome. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is becausehe's changed his stance so much.I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hittingall the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screwhimself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous battingpractice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouragedbad hitting habits.Russ Smith*******************************************************************************"I don't know anything about X's, but I know about some O."

And it isn't because I loathe the Phillysports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favoriteAL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem   to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on  Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the  country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score  being reported on WIP.2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss  from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.Anyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.-Alan

Alomarhas established a high level of defense, Baerga has not.  I would bet onAlomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall.-- Dale J.

The Ack-people have been spotted onmany teams to date, but it appears that the Orioles staff (mentionedabove) and the Expos bullpen (Barnes, Walton, Fassero, Gardiner andRojas) have been the prime target. Apparently John Wetteland was roughedup by the Ack-people during spring training due to the fact that hissystem rejected the takeover, and has been on the DL ever since. Contactthe authorities!

RBI are a worthless stat. Of course, so is stolen bases because sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run.

The topic of conversationwas a new ball park for the Phillies.  The location for this new parkwas suggested to be near 30th St Station.  At the time, the mayor wasoptimisitic that in the future this could become a reality.  Hasthere been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream?I know the city of Philadelphia has other projects ahead, such as thenew convention center and the upcoming Spectrum II.  But it would benice to see this a reality.  It is planned that the Phillies leavethe VET and leave it solely to the Eagles (and if that's the case,the Eagles should make the VET a grass stadium, but that's anotherstory).

I believe all of thepeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. Ifeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve togo but that they would deserve it more. IMHO Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were hecould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do notthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for thegame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and Istill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had severalseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite abit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some otherpeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantialcontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this aresome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when hewas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up toand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame Ithink it deserves some consideration.Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately woulddeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.Darrell Evans - No.Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (althougha silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am notsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's boththe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Justthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off thetop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.|> |>      Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody|> giving|> |> Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,|> marginal.|> |> Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there.

Italked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have beeninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have verygood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbersoffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run forevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would haveshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays savedgames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win agame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about morethan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As doesGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.|>      Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors|> so|> |> liberally.

Gee, can these guys even compare to|> |> the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?|> Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someonemaking a case for him. Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone mightbring up his name.Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he stillhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then myprobably will turn into a definately.Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about himhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did nothear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has thecontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I wouldnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not eventop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Famebecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALLthe possible votes.So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably dobut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at leastnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and RyanMaybe - Murray and L.

The only category that I see which shows an advantage>for Alomar is OBP Hmmm...what about walks and SB? Baerga got clobbered by Alomar in OBP andbeat him in SLG by a lesser margin. Even putting aside any other factors,a player with a 51 point edge in OBP is more productive than a player witha 28 point edge in SLG. The issue has been studied before, and I doubt youcould come up with any convincing argument the other way. People see the batting average and the HR, but they don't really know  their value is worth unless they've studied the issue closely. The fact is thatBaerga ate up a LOT more outs than Alomar; while Baerga was making outs,Alomar was drawing walks and being on base for Carter, Winfield et.al.Gord Niguma(fav player: John Olerud)

The way they were used atthat time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had oneof his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout ofthe Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitcheda complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. Itwould be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for theyear for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league.Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games thanthe other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during thatstretch.-----Eric Smitherics@netcom.comerics@infoserv.comCI$: 70262,3610

A couple games at County stadium will be great to relieve tension, but I thought "Why not go to Wrigley for a game too?"    I see the Cubs are playing the Phillies on Sat (2:05 start, I believethat's Eastern time listed). I figured it would be fun to bounce down toWrigley for the day game and live it up a little. I'm wondering if anyone(esp. Cubbie fans) have some advice on:   1) If I'm taking 41 (Skokie Hwy) south until it runs into 94, what's the      best way to get to Wrigley? I'm planning on getting there an hour or       two early and paying through the nose for parking to keep things easy.   2) Is it probable that I'll be able to walk up and get bleacher seats (2 or     3) on game day? I figure since it's early in the year, Ryno's out and      the weather isn't great I should be able to get tickets. If not, what's      the best way to get advance tickets; can I call the Cubs' ticket office     directly and pick up tickets at the will call window?    3) Any advice on where to eat before or after the game?   4) Do they allow inflatable I-luv-ewe dolls (present from Lundy) into the      bleachers? :-)  -- Dave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch      Blue Jays - Do it again in '93 kirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu                        New .. quotes out of context!"Not to beat a dead horse, but it's been a couple o' weeks .. this  disappoints me..punishments..discharges..jackhammering.." - Stephen Lawrence

I know it is early, but that is all we have to go on.  Atlanta is just so strong with their .188 BA, Cincinnati is 2-7 coming off a sweep at Veteran's Stadium in Philadelphia, and Houston was swept in it's first three games by the Phillies in the Astrodome.

As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew thatLankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would makea perfect throw? I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don'tforget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and wentfrom last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennantrace when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him Iwill never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are headingin the right direction. One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds,but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in theEast), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than theylose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.

From: mss@netcom.com (Mark Singer)Subject: DarrrrrrrrrylOrganization: Netcom Online Communications Services (408-241-9760 login: guest)Lines: 64The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday todeath, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with twoon and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into theright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence andwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got tothe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but hemissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded thatDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentiallybehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediatevicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered withStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fanwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was obliviousto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant assoon as he realized he had made the catch.That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberrywent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lotof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore ofcosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurledfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadiumofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented andjust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into atirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who madethe catch.Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speechwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls thatare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he havebeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibilityof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, heis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocatedhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference isimpossible.Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with whatthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the firstnine games.I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pullhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilitiesof the fan.--The Beastmaster-- Mark Singer    mss@netcom.com
From: pcaster@mizar.usc.edu (Dodger)Subject: Gross Grosses Out Dodger Fans AGAIN.Organization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CALines: 60NNTP-Posting-Host: mizar.usc.eduWent to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night. Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night.In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, thena single scored the run, with the batter taking second on thethrow home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards. Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazzabatting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyderand Webster. Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out singleby Offerman. By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, butthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressiveplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runnertrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first whohad strayed a bit from first base, etc. Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going intothe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was goingthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threwto third and EASILY got the runner at third. My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen. Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the gamewith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over. Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inninggame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was freshgiven his light work out Tuesday. Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hitto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resultedin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the nextthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner onfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run hadscored long before that. Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karrosand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, butthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got histhird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was myfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps thisup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the yearhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signsof a sophomore jinx year. The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits. Dodger

I might add, though, that Greg Olson and DamonBerryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years,Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference,IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast."Two big bats." Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing.Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither playerhas *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RHare awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone.

He is onlyinsurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcheris injured during a game.     So to free up this rosterspot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why notinvoke a catcher re-substitution rule:If the last roster catcher on a team isinjured during a game, the team is permittedto substitute in his place for defensive purposesa catcher who has previously been yanked fromthe game.

There is only one way of determin-ing "best" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  atthe  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the bestthat day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  themost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine thebest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-cess  used to determine the "best" is the score of the game and it re-lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no methodinherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And thatis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player Bin their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens hasdone  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But youhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   theindividual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is theonly measure of "best" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you canpredict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.>The fact is that Morris didn't "win" any ballgames, Toronto did, in>spite of Morris' "contribution".   This has been explained to youExactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  withClemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totallymeaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based onhis ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.>many, many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.You don't have to be rude.>You are completely consumed by the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy.For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire pointof  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - IgnoratioElenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   becausehe   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimedthat in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   anindividual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose ofcomparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-formance.The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  newknowledge being produced.

Thereporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which hegave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter withthe fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers thatspeak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if notthe) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author CormacMcCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research hisbook, _All The Pretty Horses_.

Ifso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morrisallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never inhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA.

They performed well in two short series and won theWorld Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope theykeep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when theytraded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical linkbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the manwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runsout, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the differencebetween the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris.

Did Morris somehow "learn how to win" in the intervening ten years?If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over halfa run lower than 1992?

You are isolating Viola's>contribution from the rest of the team's efforts.  You can only do>this if you can say for sure what the team would have done without >Viola.  Only then can you compare.  But you cannot know how the team>would have done without Viola.  Your analysis is fallacious.OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to whichI'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Pleaseanswer yes or no, Roger: Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?AL only, please.For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable factthat a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs theteam scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as arule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find thatthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All otherthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced JackMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238for Boston), the "Red Jays" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, orenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Violapitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless youreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runshis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in thisanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola wouldnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, butthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were andevaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that "had Morrisperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.">It takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out>here in the real world guys.This is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.

Here are some of my observations:Well, had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance ofyour predictions, the responses would probably have been a bit moremeasured. Be that as it may....>1. Roger and Frank are in vintage form, and the Sox are rresponding to them.Clemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyondwhat might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox areresponding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likelysuspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to giveEasler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.>2. Greenwell is hitting as he did before his injuries.This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shownmuch power yet, though.>3. Dawson is providing the leadership and some hitting they need from him.How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it'sCalderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showingthose people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybeit's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not aswell as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.>4. Russell is finishing well.In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?>5. Fletcher is hitting well as a leadoff hitter.A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget thatZupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware ofsmall sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'dbe a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be awarethat his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers aslong as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.>6. Cooper is hitting well (I think he'll be better then Boggs in the field>and just as good at the plate)Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the "in the field" part, and I think he'll bebetter at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'llbe a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a littleluck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs,Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).>If the sox Pitch like last year (they have a better pitchiong staff, now)>and hit like they are so far, they coiuld run away with thee division. but>since I think that their hitting and pitching may not be up to the challenge>of running away with the division, I think that they win be over .500 and at>least Third if not Second or First.See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like "could run away withthe division" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the whitecoats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. IfRussell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitchjust barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they couldbe better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're toostupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossascontinues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's alefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

I live in Richmond, home of the AAA RichmondBraves, and they have this guy Ryan Klesko who hit 17 HR's at homelast year.  Now that doesn't sound like a whole lot, BUT the way the"Diamond" is built, Home runs are a rarity.   In fact, Ron Gant,Brian Hunter and David Justice all proved they could hit inRichmond.

So far, after beating Scranton (Phillies) 9-0 in the first game, thebest team in AAA history has been rather underwhelming.  Too manyexpectations I guess.

Now that the fan has MikeLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importanceHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.    Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:Morning show:  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morgantihad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP triesto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms ofsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but heinterjects humor and politics into his show.10 AM to 12 Noon:  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in theirabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has theadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the callerwho is asking about who the local team is going to draftin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN getbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say thatthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unlessit was a major story.  I would consider this even because they are two differentstyles of host.12 Noon to 2 PM:  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only beenon for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the abilityto transcend the "homer" mentality of the Philadelphia fanbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnightand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotatinghosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY andyou can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.2PM to 4PM:  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most dividedin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD doget great guests and that is the basis for their show, soit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is theappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, whichare often hilarious.  4 PM to 7 PM:  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I likeMike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when hewas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Phillyhomer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless thereis a game on that night, but you will see later for the reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.7 PM to Midnight:  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makesEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice oncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on mynerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I gonuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, MetsJets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on thewest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of courseI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, butWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.(If this is the sports station, why did they lose theIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))During the summer, itis all talk on WIP.Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, withthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

They started having  a good year, but didn't get any respect until they actually won the  division. (which is how it should be) So until the Phils AT LEAST     have a good year, not just a good 2 weeks, they won't get any respect  either. BTW, Atlanta's .188 BA is actually a compliment to how good  the Braves really are. Their record is 6-3. Can you imagine the Phils  record if they were batting .188? hahahaha. And Atlanta's hitting will  improve dramatically.    No, I'm not a Braves fan. Just defending a good team.   Orin.

Especially when it comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Soxfan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of youwith short memories. short lives, or both.  To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticismfrom those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported basedon the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the leanyears, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.  Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares ifClemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  Thefact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fanssupported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all,remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it thatfar, let alone beat Baltimore.Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Footballand Basketball.

From: hbrooks@uiatma.atmos.uiuc.edu (Harold_Brooks)Subject: RBI, RISP, and SLGOrganization: Bill's Safety Cab and Record Bar, Chickasha, OKLines: 49Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs andrelated topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can predict a player's RBIs using information about his overallperformance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)that he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculatedpredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'dtake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit tothe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's thatI've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them andb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If yourun a simple least squares fit to the data you get (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which issignificant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like thefit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts thelow HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or itcould just be Ozzie.  The results:                           RBI-HR         Years        Actual   PredictedCarter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) thatRBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overalland how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.More later,Harold-- Harold Brooks                    hbrooks@uiatma.atmos.uiuc.eduNational Severe Storms Laboratory (Norman, OK)"I used to work for a brewery, too, but I didn't drink on the job."-P.

Also the Mets (my other least favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to behitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lotsof hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress onsituational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lowerthis year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose andLankford and Zeile's off year).I don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the Filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  Give the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games and we'll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching staff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make thedifference.On a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some baseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked where to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied "Fair."  I remember it being in the "They Said It" section of Sports Illustrated.I would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.GO REDBIRDS!!Gary Wieman

I'm not sure ifBarry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he strokedthree very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year inaddition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hittersseem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb.McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball.So on & so forth.I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June beforepeople are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wipedout a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factorin helping them significantly improve over last year.Joe Loosloos@cup.hp.com

Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long,and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique.Or so I thought.I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but everything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms areCLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite. The new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fenceare very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the topof the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at thebottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.These things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real businessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out. Just like he used to tell his checkers, "If the customers don't come back, I don'tneed as many checkers". This isn't a knock on Bob Lurie - he was a competentbusinessman but he didn't deal much with the general public.I'll give an example of how the level of service has changed. The onion dispenser jammed as I was using it. An attendant came over, apoligized forthe problem and proceeded to fix the machine. After he was done, he cleanedthe machine and said he was glad to be able to help. In the old days, therewas no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say "Go tothe stand 100 feet away - they might be able to help".All in all, it was a fun day--Craig Eid e-mail address    craige@hpsad.sad.hp.com

As muchas fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winningthe game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware thatthis is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team winin any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his firstinstinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catchit himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on thefield.Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it ornot.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize hisfirst responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win.Danieldaniel@caldera.usc.edu

Who won the game?-Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs.-Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent defensive plays behind him to do so.-Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of the inning.Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit forthe win.How about the offense?-Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either one, the Sox would have lost in nine.-Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single.-Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first to third when...-Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning.-Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of a help, but it was something.-Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson werecredited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hitthat set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute asmuch as Richardson?Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant thanruns.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided thegame-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base withonly one out!Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  Youcan argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in theclutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.

The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which    much of the net community has settled. Please DON'T bring them up again    unless there's something truly new to be discussed. The net can't set    public policy, that's what your representatives are for.    WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS    Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints    have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on    microfilm.    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch    from.    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean    sheet design.    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being    "scooped" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early    in a mission.    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to    pursue are:    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel    Salisbury in "Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG    Controversy," *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7. Another good    article, which also reviews the events preceding Galileo's launch,    "Showdown at Pad 39-B," by Robert G. Nichols, appeared in the November    1989 issue of *Ad Astra*.

Hanson, editor; DOE Document No.  DOE/TIC-22800;    Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., April 1980.)    IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER    From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from    the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible    for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted    study, Charles Jackman.    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year  Shuttle sources:  725,000 kilograms/year    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the    total stratospheric chlorine sources.    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons    do at the present time.    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space    Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D. Sze, Journal of Geophysical    Research, 95, 18583-18590, 1990.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE    If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a    minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to    watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly some    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,    you're dying. The limits are not really known.

Koestler ed., NASA CR-329 (Nov 1965).    _Experimental Animal Decompression to a Near Vacuum Environment_, R.W.    Bancroft, J.E. Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin    team's medical/forensic report.    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT    You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit    because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly    specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit    spacecraft.    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]    THE "FACE ON MARS"    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't    know the address) to study the Face.    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or    sci.astro.    V. DiPeitro and G.

From: leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech)Subject: Space FAQ 14/15 - How to Become an AstronautKeywords: Frequently Asked QuestionsArticle-I.D.: cs.astronaut_733694515Expires: 6 May 1993 20:01:55 GMTDistribution: worldOrganization: University of North Carolina, Chapel HillLines: 313Supersedes: <astronaut_730956661@cs.unc.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: mahler.cs.unc.eduArchive-name: space/astronautLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT    First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA    announcement.    Q. How do I become an astronaut?    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle "mission    specialist".    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.It is not enough    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in    another seems to be a frequent winner.    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.(DO NOT get a    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.    Keep your nose clean.    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant "you    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first".    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance    to demonstrate motivation.    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.    NASA    National Aeronautics and Space Administration    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center    Houston, Texas    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates    ==================================================================    Astronaut Candidate Program    ---------------------------    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be    considered.    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation    program.    Space Shuttle Program Description    ---------------------------------    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and    flight crew.    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include    government agencies and private industries.    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA    astronauts.    Pilot Astronaut    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other    payload operations.    Mission Specialist Astronaut    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific    experimental operations.    Astronaut Candidate Program    ===========================    Basic Qualification Requirements    --------------------------------    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to    submitting an application.    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be    substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's    degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic    preparation is important.    2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a    civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following    specific standards: Distant visual acuity:      20/150 or better uncorrected,      correctable to 20/20, each eye. Blood pressure:      140/90 measured in sitting position.    3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.    Pilot Astronaut Candidate:    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of    academic preparation is important.    2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight    test experience highly desirable.    3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following    specific standards: Distant visual acuity:      20/50 or better uncorrected      correctable to 20/20, each eye. Blood pressure:      140/90 measured in sitting position.    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.    Citizenship Requirements    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of    the United States.    Note on Academic Requirements    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the    sciences, are not considered qualifying:      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,Medical Technology, etc.)      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, PhysiologicalPsychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).      - Degrees in Nursing.      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.    Application Procedures    ----------------------    Civilian    The application package may be obtained by writing to:NASA Johnson Space CenterAstronaut Selection OfficeATTN: AHXHouston, TX 77058    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as    supervisors and references may be contacted.    Active Duty Military    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application    procedures will be disseminated by each service.    Selection    ---------    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered    will be notified of the outcome of the process.    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following    their establishment.    General Program Requirements    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during    their candidate period.    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a    specified tour of duty.    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.    Pay and Benefits    ----------------    Civilians    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements    and experience.    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and    participation in group health and life insurance plans.    Military    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and    other similar military matters.NEXT: FAQ #15/15 - Orbital and Planetary Launch Services

Subject: Space FAQ 01/15 - IntroductionFrom: leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech)Expires: 6 May 1993 19:53:44 GMTOrganization: University of North Carolina, Chapel HillKeywords: Frequently Asked QuestionsSupersedes: <intro_730956346@cs.unc.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: mahler.cs.unc.eduLines: 310Archive-name: space/introLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO    INTRODUCTION    This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenetgroups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers tofrequently asked questions and other reference material which is worthpreserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently askedquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email toleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' toyour KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreaderthat can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed downby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available inthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. Thepoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing oldanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressingthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are providedbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.    Questions fall into three basic types:    1) Where do I find some information about space?    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended    discussion.    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.    3) Miscellanous queries.    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of    FAQ postings.    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE    Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]    Edit "Subject:" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth100 posts).    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUESTnot SPACE.    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check allreferences.)    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you'reresponding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mailor article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the'reply' function of mailers will work.    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyonewill get on TV anyway.    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals(use carriage returns).    INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS    I've attempted to break the postings up into related areas. There isn't    a keyword index yet; the following lists the major subject areas in each    posting.

Subject: Space FAQ 02/15 - Network ResourcesFrom: leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech)Expires: 6 May 1993 19:54:26 GMTOrganization: University of North Carolina, Chapel HillKeywords: Frequently Asked QuestionsSupersedes: <net_730956391@cs.unc.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: mahler.cs.unc.eduLines: 241Archive-name: space/netLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:15 $NETWORK RESOURCESOVERVIEW    You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of    computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to    special 'servers'.    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more    specialized mailing lists described below.    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was    posted.    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make    it the preferred option.MAILING LISTS    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the    International Space University (in only its second change of management    in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body    should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of    a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are    available by anonymous FTP. Retrievejulius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README    for further details.    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources    as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.    GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning    System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to    gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.    Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in    space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.    Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;    discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid    capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to    space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and    selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from    gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,    or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have FTP access.    SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and    Development of Space and other interested parties. Email    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying "SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your    name". Email saying "INDEX SEDS-L" to list the archive contents.    SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status    reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in    Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying "SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name" to join.    Email saying "INDEX SEDSNEWS" to list the archive contents.    Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which    carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him    to join the list.    As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a    mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate    'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list    address rather than the request address.PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION    In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is    posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group    sci.space.news created for this purpose). Please remember that the    individuals posting this information are performing a service for all    net readers, and don't take up their time with frivolous requests.

This system is not open for public use. Specifically, NASA    personnel and procurement operations are regarded with some sensitivity.    Contractors must renegotiate their contracts. The Fair and Open    Procurement Act does not look kindly to those having inside information.    Contractors and outsiders caught using this type of information can    expect severe penalities. Unauthorized access attempts may subject you    to a fine and/or imprisonment in accordance with Title 18, USC, Section    1030. If in fact you should should learn of unauthorized access, contact    NASA personnel.    Claims have been made on this news group about fraud and waste. None    have ever been substantiated to any significant degree. Readers    detecting Fraud, Waste, Abuse, or Mismanagement should contact the NASA    Inspector General (24-hours) at 800-424-9183 (can be anonymous) or writeNASAInspector GeneralP.O.

Subject: Space FAQ 03/15 - Data SourcesFrom: leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech)Expires: 6 May 1993 19:55:35 GMTOrganization: University of North Carolina, Chapel HillKeywords: Frequently Asked QuestionsSupersedes: <data_730956427@cs.unc.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: mahler.cs.unc.eduLines: 463Archive-name: space/dataLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:07 $ONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES, DATA, ETC.INTRODUCTION    A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and    other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.    A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the    remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as    providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions    on how to make requests.    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.    Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.VIEWING IMAGES    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly    large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To    read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,    use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu    (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP    sites.    The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image    formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document    is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at    pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory    pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.ONLINE ARCHIVES    NASA AMES    Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via    anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press    releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.    FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in    pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the    archive (the index is about 200K by itself).    To access the archives by email, send a letter to    archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:send SPACE Indexsend SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this    section for images or programs.    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are    available in these collections.    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item "VIEWING IMAGES" below).    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to    contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing    specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.    Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee    (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).    NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM    The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and    provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data    from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140    data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can    be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS    also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,    ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to    query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,    keywords, title words, or abstract text words.

NASA SPACELINK    SpaceLink is an online service located at Marshall Space Flight Center    in Huntsville, Alabama. The system is specifically designed for    teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current    and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and    technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom    activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a    number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA    Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it    does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments    for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered    electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by    mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during    missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop    between the user and NASA.    SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs    useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images    from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.

The    publication was enormously successful: we distributed 2000 copies to    space enthusiasts across the country and even sent a few to people in    Great Britain, Australia, and Ecuador. Due to the tremendous response to    the first edition, PPS has published an expanded, up-to-date second    edition of the guide.    The 40-page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full-time job    opportunities as well as graduate school programs. The second edition of    "Space Jobs" features strategies for entering the space field and    describes positions at consulting and engineering firms, NASA, and    non-profit organizations. The expanded special section on graduate    schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing    to space policy. Additional sections include tips on becoming an    astronaut and listings of NASA Space Grant Fellowships and Consortia, as    well as NASA Centers for the Commercial Development of Space.

HOW TO NAME A STAR AFTER A PERSON    Official names are decided by committees of the International    Astronomical Union, and are not for sale. There are purely commercial    organizations which will, for a fee, send you pretty certificates and    star maps describing where to find "your" star. These organizations have    absolutely no standing in the astronomical community and the names they    assign are not used by anyone else. It's also likely that you won't be    able to see "your" star without binoculars or a telescope.

Bussard, Journal ofPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the    thrust-power "gain" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, "high-thrust"    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer    "high-thrust" flight capability. One performance example shows a    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in    Earth/moon space."The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems forAerospace Flight Propulsion" by Robert W.

Farnsworth/Hirsch    demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in    1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising    stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the    panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim    Bowery]"PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications", byPaul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of FusionEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather    than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid    MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]    ION DRIVES:Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACEarchive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe theSERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters inthe 1960s and 70s.

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest.

For the most up to date information on upcoming    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news    frequently.    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).    The "Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual," ASC G&C 2102,    says:"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude iscommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch towerclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate anegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Otheradvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abortmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view ofthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gainingdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) targetin second stage."    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try    to interpret.    1)We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.    2)Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attackbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the"relative wind") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary linebetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightlynegative angle ("a negative q-alpha").This causes a little bit of"downward" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Zdirection) and this force "alleviates structural loading."We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about themost "delicate" part of the vehicle.    3)The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry moremass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, orto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would bethe case if we didn't roll ("performance gain").    4)The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicatedflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abortmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site ("decreased abort maneuvercomplexity").    5)The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radioantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radioantennae on the Orbiter ("improved S-band look angles").    6)The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is ahelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.    7)The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body ismore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocityin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to itsvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.    This all begs the question, "Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to    achieve that attitude?"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the "top"    [Orbiter side] and the "bottom" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle    guy.)    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.He added that the "roll    maneuver" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total    maneuver is really expressed as a "quaternion," a grad-level-math    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element    array.    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite    for these viewers.    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions    are not being covered.

Matthew    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).US PLANETARY MISSIONS    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted    from the expression "R-dot-bar sub n" (nth smoothed value of derivative    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary    space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from    this preliminary scan that Mars was a "dead" world in both the    geological and biological sense.    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information    that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times    that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface    of an ocean.    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away    the concept of Mars as a "dead" planet, first made from the basic    measurements of MARINER 4.    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket    launcher autopilot failed.    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup    images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever    to do so.    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made    the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before    its batteries failed.    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon    and drifted off into solar orbit.    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored    the Tycho crater region in 1968.    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the    engineers' efforts through May of 1983.    An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut    down on April 12, 1980.    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle    is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10    satellites and one more ring were discovered.    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were    discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the    location of the heliopause.SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first     craft in solar orbit.    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was     also a test for future Mars missions.    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images     from surface.    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.    LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in      1972.    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in      1976.    SOVIET VENUS PROBES    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions       lost enroute in 1961.    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in       February of 1966. No images were returned.    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles       similar in 1969.    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in       1972.    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar       mission.    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections ofplanet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in     March of 1986.    SOVIET MARS PROBES    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased     enroute the following year.    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red     Planet in 1971.    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.     probe MARINER 9.    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit     with its flyby bus.    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to       human/computer error.    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week       before scheduled Phobos landing.    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their    space program remains to be seen.JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on    January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for    a Japanese spacecraft.    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists    to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March    19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the    approach:Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 kmPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 kmInclination: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)Period: 4.7 daysPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good    public and university library. Some of the more recently published works    can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market    bookstore.    General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):      J.

Other works and periodicals:    NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space    probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry    these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission    you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study    some of the books listed above.    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you    probably know.    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas    scintillation proportional counters.    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true    nature of Saturn's rings.

Has returned    the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to    Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have    essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data    compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from    the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve    approximately 70% of its original objectives.

Has made    multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,    into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to    orbit a satellite around the Moon.    MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire    surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity    map.    MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.    Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in    transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for    one martian year (687 days).    TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched    8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.    OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron    Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro    Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp). I'm attempting to track changes based    on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome.    1993 Missionso ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus]    ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) is to perform    a wide-field sky survey in the "soft" (low-energy) X-ray    spectrum. It will scan the entire sky every six months to search    for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white    dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also    search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron    stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos    National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development    mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the    technology. Contact project investigator Jeffrey J Bloch    (jjb@beta.lanl.gov) for more information.o Wind [Aug, Delta II rocket]    Satellite to measure solar wind input to magnetosphere.o Space Radar Lab [Sep, STS-60 SRL-01]    Gather radar images of Earth's surface.o Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer [Dec, Pegasus rocket]    Study of Stratospheric ozone.o SFU (Space Flyer Unit) [ISAS]    Conducting space experiments and observations and this can be    recovered after it conducts the various scientific and    engineering experiments.

Box 605Amherst, NY 14226-0605    COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS    Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on    studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.     (1/3.4)    D = S  S  c  K  W    : crater diameter in km g  p  f  n       (1/6)    S = (g /g )    : gravity correction factor for bodies other than     g  e  t      Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and gis the surface    e      t      gravity of the target body. This scaling is      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for      other bodies.(1/3.4)    S = (p / p )    : correction factor for target density p  ,     p  a   t    t      p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U       a      crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average      rock on the continental shields.    C    : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km      in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).    (1/3.4)    K    : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)     n      empirically determined from the Jangle U      nuclear test crater.      3   2       19    W = pi * d* delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )    : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent      given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile      density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3      g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.    An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing    asteroids.    Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor    Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in    diameter.    More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):    Asteroid    Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy    diameter (km)       (impacts/year)   (* 5*10^20 ergs)     10    10     10^-810^9      1 1 000     10^-610^6      0.1       100 000     10^-410^3    assuming simple scaling laws. Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT    equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb.    References:    Gehrels, T. 1985 Asteroids and comets. _Physics Today_ 38, 32-41.

It also has a very extensive referencelist covering essentially all of the reference material in thefield.]    MAP PROJECTIONS AND SPHERICAL TRIGNOMETRY    Two easy-to-find sources of map projections are the "Encyclopaedia    Brittanica", (particularly the older volumes) and a tutorial appearing    in _Graphics Gems_ (Academic Press, 1990). The latter was written with    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John    Snyder's USGS publication "Map Projections--A Working Manual", USGS    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,    "An Album of Map Projections", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and    tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.    A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,    (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call    them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a    check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up    for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.    A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:R. Miller and F. Reddy, "Mapping the World in Pascal",Byte V12 #14, December 1987Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. Ademo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (6,000 point) coastline datais available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.    Some references for spherical trignometry are:_Spherical Astronomy_, W.M.

Convert parallax into distance using the    formula in part 6 of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates    on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and    spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and    scale this by the distance.    Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog    (sources listed in FAQ section 3) or "The Catalogue of Stars within 25    parsecs of the Sun" (in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data and stars.doc on    ames.arc.nasa.gov).NEXT: FAQ #5/15 - References on specific areas

Let's do it right thistime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:[1] microgravity/vacuum process research[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)[3] spacecraft maintenence The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was tocentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meettheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganizationand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on thesetwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvementin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the constellation.  Firstly, different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the taskis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environmentsand are also prime candidates for constellization.[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab forshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area isinexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelabto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.We might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system canbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiationenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelterof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, sinceastronauts will have little practical use in the space programuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, usingastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellationtether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravityin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of theradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life supportmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VRinterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billionsare spent on astronauts.[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperatedrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers canpractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stucksolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can bespun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsatcompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.By applying the successful constellation strategy, and gettingrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, wehave radically improved the capability of the program whilegreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can studylife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuumresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purposeorbits.N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space explorationas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be usedto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting andsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology canbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecologygreenhouses on Mars at low cost.-- Nick Szabo szabo@techboook.com

Hiermee ontstond de tweedeuniversiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerstewaarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkundein de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar devoorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studentensterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scalaaan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren eenplanetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantalvoordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de DiesNatalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Erstaat echter meer op stapel.Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan eensterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van hetsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van hethuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht dedeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven vande stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In deeerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers eenbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens eenhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindproduktenzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tothet stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt opeen apart vel.Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaarsstudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDENZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goedgaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de RadiosterrenwachtWesterbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussenhet heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal vaneen snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snelopvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken entrachten te verklaren.Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met detechnische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijnnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zaler niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagsetechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) enf 16,- (inclusief lunch).

Anyone out there know?Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.  Whengraphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft,presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) thearea on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraftdoesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational)envelope'. Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actuallyflies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there areare the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilotsdo for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close thecorrespondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- inessence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to wherethe airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this isdone is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generallycarefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and howfar is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speedtaxi tests).I'm sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know aboutthis process (and then some).-- "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I don't speak for others and they don't speak for me.

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, andcommercial space.  This is how it went...After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) PattyMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heardthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were notbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talkingto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was anotherwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic thatwe brought up.But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporatealigned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access toLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourismpaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees theatmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smogover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out thatthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to otherfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle businessangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personalcommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs providedin those sectors.Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in orderto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts areproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that theresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts alongthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actuallyhappen immediatly there.The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that weknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that theycould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't knowthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people whoreally did know the answers.Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  Hesaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, thiswould be something that she would be very interested in, although theydo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in thestate 1 week out of 6 these days.All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.John.

Beyond that, I have no other info.The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside ofthe orbit of Mercury.The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observedperihelion precession and the value it should have had according toNewtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observationsand calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe laterimproved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's systemof equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptuneand since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbitof Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing wasafoot with Mercury.But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rateit does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantlycurved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamicsof moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one ofit's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precessionof Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb'snumbers rather than Leverrier's.)Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequentefforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radarhave been fruitless.-Bill Gawne "Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe  are the laws of the universe."                       - G.

The wind behaves like a fluid pipe.It becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from thewing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.If they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and forcecompression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).If you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bendinto,  then drag is reduced.   Essentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulfremain constant for all areas of the fuselage.  That is where the wings aresubtract, teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage.pat

I've typed it in verbatim, for youfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recentlydiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign GuidanceDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science andTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate ofthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the SpaceStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance tothe committee in their deliberations on the redesign ofthe space station.A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7billion and a high option of $9 billion will beconsidered by the committee. Each option would coverthe total expenditures for space station from fiscalyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds fordevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttleintegration, facilities, research operations support,transition cost and also must include adequate programreserves to insure program implementation within theavailable funds.Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved withinthe NASA budget for the President's new technologyinvestment. As a result, station options above $7billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions inthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a spacestation option of $9 billion would require $2 billionin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.Gibbons presented the information at an organizationalsession of the advisory committee. Generally, themembers-designate focused upon administrative topicsand used the session to get acquainted. They alsoreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientationon the process the Station Redesign Team is followingto develop options for the advisory committee toconsider.Gibbons also announced that the United States and itsinternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, andCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give"full consideration" to use of Russian assets in thecourse of the space station redesign process.To that end, the Russians will be asked to participatein the redesign effort on an as-needed consultingbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of theirexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and thepossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities andsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope tobenefit from the expertise of the Russian participantsin assessing Russian systems and technology. Theoverall goal of the redesign effort is to developoptions for reducing station costs while preserving keyresearch and exploration capabilities. Carefulintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor inachieving that goal.Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton iscommitted to the redesigned space station and to makingevery effort to preserve the science, the technologyand the jobs that the space station program represents.However, he also is committed to a space station thatis well managed and one that does not consume thenational resources which should be used to invest inthe future of this industry and this nation."NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russianparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Marylandunder the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.

Oh well.I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the operations section of NASA was talking about what future missionswere going to be funded.  I don't remember his name or title off handand I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case, he was asked about that very matter: "Why can't we spend a few million moreto keep instruments that we already have in place going?"His responce was that there are only so many $ available to him andthe lead time on an instrument like a COBE, Magellan, Hubble, etcis 5-10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on usingcurrent instruments in the current budget enviroment he would havevery little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that, surein the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular,however starting a few years after he had retired he would becomeone of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for notfunding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Justas he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices, he owed itto whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing newmissions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments beforethe last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.-- Covert C Beachdragon@access.digex.com

The article starts with "A leaderof the NASA team in charge of redesigning the plannedspace station said yesterday the job is tough and maybe impossible." O'Connor is quoted saying whether it ispossible to cut costs that much and still provide formeaningful research "is a real question for me."O'Connor said "everything is fair game," including"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with theaerospace industry, chopping management of the spacestation program at some NASA facilities around thecountry, working closely with the Russian space stationMir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement themanned space shuttle fleet."O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design optionsso far, and they are sorting the serious candidatesinto three categories based on cost.The Post says O'Connor described the design derivedfrom the current SSF as a high cost option (I believeKathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. Ilistened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the presson Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connortalked about how the White House wants three options,sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another partof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he hasformed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single LaunchCore ["wingless Orbiter"] @ JSC. Later, in response toa reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor saythe option based on a SSF redesign was a "moderate"cost option, in between low & high cost options. Notthe "high cost" option as Sawyer wrote).The article goes on to describe the other two optionsas "one features modules that could gradually be fittedtogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. Theother is a core facility that could be deposited inorbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That optionwould use existing hardware from the space shuttle -the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure."The last sentence in the article contradicts the title& the first paragraph. The sentence reads "He[O'Connor] said a streamlined version of the plannedspace station Freedom is still possible within theadministration's budget guidelines."

When work for a large program like   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10   billion won't be spent on anything having anything   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are   getting and the price they are paying and note that   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware   that a third of the money is going for something else."My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A coupleof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, Italked with one of the cost experts here in Space Stationat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post aresponse immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposedto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHzdata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty lowon the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekendin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSFto 15,000 science teachers.]First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' doesexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is04/2.2 = 1.8%Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but Iwill concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocketchange.I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 couldbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on fundsthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at somestates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eatthe food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get ittake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the fundswe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers infront of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 fundsgo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a taxrate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at thecenter, and not to the prime contracts.This leads to the obvious question "What is the governmentdoing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. Abig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happensto the balance of the funds, which aren't eatenup by the center tax?)"At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supportingdevelopment funds (as they are supporting the developmentwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds tosetup our own testbed, to checkout the electricalpower system architecture. Our testbed has a real lifesolar array field (left over from solar cell researchresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DCswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulatedloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recentchange evaluation involving concerns about the stabilityof the power system.We have also used the supporting development money topurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on lifetesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility inIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells ontest recently hit the four year life test milestone.38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (theon-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis usedthe supporting development funds to purchase personalcomputers and work stations, for performing systemanalyses (like modeling of the performance of theelectrical power system, availability calculationsusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a database with information on weight of the powersystem elements).Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not allgo into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the directordoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal tothe director to get money from this fund to lookat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'services at the Center, like the library, the central computer services division, the Contractor who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is ratherdifficult to determine what percentage of theSSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To getan accurate figure, you would have to takethe annual expenditure for the library (for example),and then divide by the amount of the library fundsused to support SSF (which would be hard tocompute by itself - how would you figure outwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it onthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-weekversus the rest of the center personnel). You wouldthen have to compare this estimate of the SSFportion of the library expense with the portion ofthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, butwe underpay for snow removal? Talk abouta burecratic nightmare!My last point is that I can't believe your claim thatCongress has never heard of the term 'center tax.'Unfortunately, all of the NASA testimony beforeCongress isn't on a computer, so I can't do a simpleword search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely,in some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methodswere documented for Congress?

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technologydemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)rocket ship.        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White SandsMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start inmid-June.        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast forSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of afollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required fora sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister governmentagencies.        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs fororbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recentchanges in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTOless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X asa step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,said Col.  Simon "Pete" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Wordendeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for theprogram. "I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money Ihave available to spend," he quipped at a press conference at McDonnellDouglas Astronautics headquarters.        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbitalobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the "better,faster, cheaper" approach to hardware development.  The agency believesthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that "leapfrog" ahead ofevolutionary technology developments.        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a "build a little, test alittle" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He saidthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --showed how today's engineers could move beyond the "miracles of ourparents' time."        "The key is management," Worden said. "SDIO had a very light handon this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable."        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden saidlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will becrucial. "It's essential we do not end up with a large managementstructure where the price goes up exponentially."        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of theHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. "This is the directionwe're going to have to go," said Rep.  George Brown, the committee'sDemocratic chairman. "Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren'tsustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has."        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.Joking that "a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if itwere left to the civil space agency.        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnellDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-stagedrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. "Let's notbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!"         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said theprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with itsC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautiousabout a large private secotro commitment. "On very large ventures,companies put in seed money," said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'senior vice president for space systems. "You need strong governmentinvestments."        While the government and industry continue to differ on fundingfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach todevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to DouglasAircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way forthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry couldeventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will "expand the envelope"of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  Thefirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticletake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000feet.        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The finaltests will include a "pitch-over" manever that rotates the vehicle backinto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles "Pete"Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehiclesaircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automatedcheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology willbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than thePratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquidhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds ofthrust        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 modelhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-onthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapidturnaround.        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employtri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff andthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt hasa technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsiblefor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and TechnologyPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on theRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidanceto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the spacestation.        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and ahigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Eachoption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscalyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, researchoperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate programreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASAbudget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsettingreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space stationoption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASAbudget over the next 5 years.        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session ofthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused uponadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They alsoreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process theStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisorycommittee to consider.        Gibbons also announced that the United States and itsinternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- havedecided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use ofRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in theredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesignteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIRand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise ofthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  Theoverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducingstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achievingthat goal.        Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to theredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve thescience, the technology and the jobs that the space station programrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is wellmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which shouldbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation."        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russianparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space ScienceCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of RoaldSagdeev.------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy

You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just thatbetween stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding ofyour valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.>Please quote the 'it' I took issue with.  I believe you will see (if>you look) that what I was and am taking issue with is Mr Szabo's idea>that the manned program should be scrapped until such time as his>toaster-based infrastructure is finished.  All Hail the Szabo Plan!*** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or youwould have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reasonto ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretationsthat you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults moremeaning than they ever should have had.My reading of what Nick actually said is that "people aren't required inall parts of all space processes", so your taking issue with his opinionsregarding people in the space program, I read as "People are required inall parts of all space processes."  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'mso patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eatyour terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto andstring models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'donly be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's yourjob, Fred.And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points,simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan'that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors thatyou do as much as anyone.>More deliberate lack of understanding, Tommy?No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts madeyou imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even thoughit's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone asdense as myself.>>>>If you have a problem with Nick's delivery, address that.  The way you>>>>bait, you're perpetuating the lack of discourse that you complain of.>>>No, Tommy, the 'bait' is that which elicits the response.  *NICK*>>>'baits'; I just flame him for being an obnoxious fool.>>I don't really care who started it.  I read this list to get information>>and other's views on the issues to which it was dedicated, not to be>>your Mom (He started it!  No, he did!) or to hear about why Nick is a very>>bad guy.  If you think flaming is bad, stop flaming, or at least get to>>the point in the first post, instead of explaining yourself all the time.>That's nice, Tommy.

How could it be otherwise?>I think it's neat how all this criticism from you started after your>'fatherly' admonitions to me about how such things should be handled>outside Usenet were somewhat rebuffed.  Being a little hypocritical,>Tommy (to go with the immaturity)?  Or is this just the pique of a>net.ghod wannabe who got turned down by someone he *thought* was new>(and hence could be 'instructed' -- Tommy, I saw you come on the net).Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you sawme come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years.If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I wentdown exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It'sjust amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that'sno worse than your own.Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical,while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and mycomplaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-callingisn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I mightsee it better, Fred."Net.ghod wannabe"?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted mymotivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (asyour insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care aboutpeople that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was toimpress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on privatemail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such ajerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands.Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables andbringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuablepurpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I triedto make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried tocommunicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) jobwith NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well,I just hope you're happy.  Please leave me alone, now.  I just don'thave the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me.  Maybe Nickor Pat can approach your high standards, but I'm dropping it now.-Tommy Mac-------------------------------------------------------------------------Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk   \\ As the radius of vision increases,18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm \\ the circumference of mystery grows.-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The       peakups were successful. The observations were executed as       scheduled, and no problems were reported.     o Observations were made using the High Speed Photometer of the Planet       Uranus during an occultation by a faint star in Capricornus. These       observations will help in our understanding of the planet's       atmospheric radiative and dynamical processes. This event occurred       close to the last quarter moon, and special arrangements had to be       made to modify the lunar limit tests to allow these observations.

My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny masses, sitting very close to Jupiter, play any role whatsoever in the problem.   Or, to put it more technically, the extra "volume" they add to the phase space of possible capture trajectories is negligible.  Jupiter is 2E27 kg, while the Galilean satellites are around 1E23.  Also, as I said, the few references that I've looked at do not mention outgassing or breakup as important processes.  The important thing is a Jupiter-Sun-comet "reverse slingshot" that leads to a weakly Jupiter-bound orbit for the comet (at least a temporary one).

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquirecelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinkedto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activityfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio RelayAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command losstimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was receivedproperly.5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verifythe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experimentdata; long term trend analysis is continuing.6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine theoptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminaryanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulationindex is near the optimal level.7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thrusterflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushedduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significantchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  Thesemeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC specialanomaly team.10.

Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance testfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verifythe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacementfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetryrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC TelemetrySubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA wasnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTSdata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) ofthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.TRAJECTORY     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectorystatus was as follows:Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hourDistance from Jupiter       543,973,900 kmRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 secondsSPECIAL TOPIC1.

(818) 354-5011Contact:  Mary A. HardinFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993#1506     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report thesuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed tomeasure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.     The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airportreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and tookmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate datawith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).       The data from the balloon flight will also be compared toreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttleDiscovery.     "We launch these balloons several times a year as part of anongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is activelyinvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in threeimportant ways," said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator onthe balloon research campaign.       "There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite," hecontinued.  "The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truthfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its ownright."     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add morepieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically themid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helpsscientists construct more accurate computer models which areinstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPLinstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measuresozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwaveradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fouriertransform infrared interferometer which monitors how theatmosphere absorbs sunlight.      Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to groundstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commandedto separate from the balloon.     "We needed to fly through sunset to make the infraredmeasurements," Margitan explained, "and we also needed to fly indarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear."     It will be several weeks before scientists will have thecompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forwardtheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard SpaceFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARSscientists.         The balloon was launched by the National Scientific BalloonFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under acontract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon waslaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind directionand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less thanone-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubicmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated withhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weighbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  Thescientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) poundsand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's UpperAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative MeasurementsProgram.                                                      #####     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation                                                  | instead.

They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to havesome. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbitalprototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive foranother year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (withmajor modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for aset of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers ofthis program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M nextyear for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be madefor spending half on DC.Public support is STILL critical.

It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell ScienceCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in SpaceMaterials Processing with the Space Systems Division of RockwellInternational in Downey, California.  He is a recognized worldauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written orcoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrialmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. DavidCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legalexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to buildthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with apotential to power the globe.   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly halffrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientificconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunarsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmittedthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormoussource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's everincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.

That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high-power analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extendthe upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.You need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren't doing it underone of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it's notespecially hard to arrange.As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handledproperly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more emptyair to fly in, but it's basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As withmodel rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, whicheliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry.-- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

The hobbyhas been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular.Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using atotal impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch.Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified periodof time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, andall of the launches are then covered under this "blanket waiver".There is also a "High Power Safety Code" which designates morespecific rules such as launch field size, etc.Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket motors you need to certified through either the National Associationof Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association.

These aren't, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That termdenotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. Therockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, todistinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-madeammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engineswith graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A "D"engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse.An "F" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to adoubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size "O" areavailable pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above areshipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines ofsize F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not ascontrolled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocketengines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)There is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, whichholds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities(FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association ofRocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involvedin HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, andcompanies will not sell to uncertified individuals.Bottom Line: It's legit.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD   On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell ScienceCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in SpaceMaterials Processing with the Space Systems Division of RockwellInternational in Downey, California.  He is a recognized worldauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written orcoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrialmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. DavidCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legalexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to buildthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with apotential to power the globe.   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly halffrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientificconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunarsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmittedthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormoussource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's everincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of SpaceIndustrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of theNational Space Society, which is an international non-profitorganization that promotes development of the space frontier.The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

I not familiar with the ad you are speaking ofbut knowing Popular Science it is probably on the fringe.  However, youmay be speaking of "Public Missle, Inc.", which is a legitimate companythat has been around for a while.Due to advances in composite fuels, engines are now available for modelrockets using similar composites to SRB fuel, roughly 3 times more powerful than black powder motors.  They are even available in a reloadableform, i.e. aluminum casing, end casings, o-rings (!).  The engines rangefrom D all the way to M in common manufacture, N and O I've heard ofused at special occasions.To be a model rocket, however, the rocket can't contain any metal structural parts, amongst other requirements.  I've never heard of amodel rocket doing 50,000.  I have heard of > 20,000 foot flights.These require FAA waivers (of course!).  There are a few large nationallaunches (LDRS, FireBALLS), at which you can see many > K sized engineflights.  Actually, using a > G engine constitutes the area of "HighPower Rocketry", which is seperate from normal model rocketry.  Purchaseof engines like I have been describing require membership in the NationalAssociation of Rocketry, the Tripoli Rocketry Assoc., or you have tobe part of an educational institute or company involved in rocketry.Amatuer rocketry is another area.  I'm not really familiar with this,but it is an area where metal parts are allowed, along with liquid fuelsand what not.  I don't know what kind of regulations are involved, butI'm sure they are numerous.High power rocketry is very exciting!

When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,    "It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this."    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the report and Discovery was launched with its "extra payload".  NASA officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th launch date.    The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster, its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.|(Ron's ed. note:  naaahhh,  just too easy)    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that the Shuttle processor will take "appropriate action".  Thiokol is a subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch._________________________________________________________Karl AndersonDEV/2000: Configuration Management/Version ControlDept 53K/006-2Rochester, Minnesota 55901253-8044Tie 8-453-8044INTERNET: karl@vnet.ibm.comPRODIGY: CMMG96A"To seek, to strive, to find, and not to yield."Alfred Lord Tennyson

Goltz)Subject: Orion drive in vacuum -- how?Organization: UUNET Technologies Inc, Falls Church, VA, USALines: 31NNTP-Posting-Host: mimi.uu.net  Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  Itwould be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one toten megatons yield behind a "pusher plate" attached to the mainspacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfermomentum to the ship.  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosionheats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock waveinto the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see aregoing to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagneticradiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fissionproducts).  Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very muchmomentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seemsto me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombsout the back of the ship than you get from detonating them oncethey're there.  I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?  Thanks.-- --Jim---Jim Goltz                    AlterNet Engineer               goltz@uunet.uu.net

The lunar-orbit mission wasan afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hitenduring a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertioninto lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed.It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takesa long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit.If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do haveto plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced fromwhat you'd need for the brute-force approach.-- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

It specializes in airframedesign, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems.Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev,Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained atMAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of anF-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye openingexperience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a yearor so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity tosee some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive enginesfor future space craft use.If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I wouldbe glad to try and answer them.

The orbits of the Apollomotherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a fewdays.  It is *possible* that there are stable orbits here and there --the Moon's gravitational field is poorly mapped -- but we know of none.Perturbations from Sun and Earth are relatively minor issues at lowaltitudes.  The big problem is that the Moon's own gravitational fieldis quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the Moon.-- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

Thiokol provided me with samples and data ona reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solidmotor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percentAluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspectsome bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you madea bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is whatyou get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires inall directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated intothe voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  Thefoamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The majorimprovement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is theprincipal failure mode for solid propellant.Dani Eder-- Dani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/Rt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.
From: eder@hsvaic.boeing.com (Dani Eder)Subject: Re: Guns for SpaceKeywords: Sopa Gun, Space LauncerOrganization: Boeing AI Center, Huntsville, ALLines: 72Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for theLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas gunshave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physicallylocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that theoffice he works for is an administrative convenience.I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamberabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at severalhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the pistonis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tensof atmospheres.The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it untila stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inchbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. theyintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrelcould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having tomove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being usedin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameterand about 50 cm long.All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogengas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves thebarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with asheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  Theplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trappedin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plasticwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plasticprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,the projectile vaporizes.The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range isabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 kmif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gunto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they canfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFBto follow the projectiles.The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last testthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think ithad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, butI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).There are people waiting to test scramjet components in thisgun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basicallya proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kguseful payload to orbit.Dani Eder-- Dani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/Rt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.
From: eder@hsvaic.boeing.com (Dani Eder)Subject: Re: Elevator to the top floorOrganization: Boeing AI Center, Huntsville, ALLines: 56Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, theirERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressivestrength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,therefore the theoretical height for a constant section columnthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,or 75 Statute miles.Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a trusstype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constantsection column.  A constant section column is not the limit on how high you canbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross sectionas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 poundload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity incalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column crosssectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structurebelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross sectionto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mileof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the wayto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoreticallimit on area, although there will be practical limits basedon how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and howmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you needa foundation that the bedrock can support.Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costructioncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figureis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload massratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the towerheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significantatmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will stillhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losseswill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component ofrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thusthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets startingfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider windloads.  These will require more structural support over the first15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a lowenough value for it not to be a big factor.Dani Eder-- Dani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/Rt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.
From: baez@guitar.ucr.edu (john baez)Subject: End of the Space AgeArticle-I.D.: galaxy.29034Organization: University of California, RiversideLines: 82Nntp-Posting-Host: guitar.ucr.eduThere is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today'sLA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it tostir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it bysaying that I largely agree that the "Space Age" in the romantic senseof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space stationmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, "What's New" -the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that theromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation ofmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (withits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing thingspeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, Ithink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter ofnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our "mindchildren" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); butI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting aboutwhat we can do *now*.   Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEWMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of amidlife crisis.The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies nolonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economicrewards.  Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's scienceand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not ameaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, ourtechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversionpolicy.  To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologiesfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probeswould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver ofscientific and industrial innovation is now dead......Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish towrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressivelysupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billionto build space station Freedom alone.Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspokenpublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that muchof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescopeto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressivelyimplemented did not seem to matter much.Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherentvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollarspace budgets.Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apolloera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space explorationwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  ......While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded DanielGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not beingpositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America'stechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - beenslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration championsits competitiveness agenda......."I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happennow," says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA's JetPropulsion Lab in Pasadena.  "We've put off a lot of things we shouldn'thave.... I would rather see a $10-billion NASA doing well than a$40-billion one filled with white elephants."

SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY    "On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.  launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.  The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and  SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed  Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force  Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for  potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were  successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria  and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the  cafeteria.    Quest's Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the  McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude  of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational  settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social  studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available  either in the $35 Space Clipper outfit, which includes everything  needed for three launches, or as individual rockets for $12 each.  Both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-  7302."  By the way -- this is not an endorsement to buy the product nor isit an advertisement to buy the product.

Mitchell                          March 23, 1993 INTRODUCTION: In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, areal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to testtele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individualslocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainmentpurposes.Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation andtele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing ofinformationon methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout ofalunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminatingeducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity andachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate inTwenty-First century remote learning methods. Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interestsandskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,interfacingand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolvingplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students andprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal ata participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models attheLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a realfacilityexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of theconstructionof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggestedby the users themselves. This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups: - tele-operations and virtual reality research - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers - art and theater - bbs and online network users - software and game developers - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains - children - the child in all of us LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN: A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are usedfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.The "floor" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributionsis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design andcreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, andmachine-lets.  The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets: 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land; 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.  Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals. The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trainswith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and controlelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user willreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of theirdata link to LTM1. Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from aservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for theSSTOto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunarlandscape and land. Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equippedbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operatorsworldwideto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing andtakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based oncommerciallyavailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for theinterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advancedham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers. By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and addinga tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can beprovided in under 80 man hours. PLAN OF ACTION: The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project byproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual constructionof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can bemodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide "rail stock"for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphicalcommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.An initial "ground breaking" with miniature shovels will be performed fora live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initialmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started forhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completelyserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additionalbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present andthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distributionworld-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will beissuedcalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scalemodelsfor the simulated lunar colony. A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will thenbeannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being tofind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects ofthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at thattimethe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors willthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they returntotheir campus. A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and viaconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipmentaddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photoopportunity for the television community. Especially since the "action"willbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will beinvited to issue "challenges" to engineering and human factors students atuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to performlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may besimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges. The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,experimentationand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being alongterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the genericexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limitedto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which canlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars! CONCLUSION: EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who hasever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of aglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentationpurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only createworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that requirereal(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds inspace.

Final responsibility forthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadershipand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set upas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFCand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston tofinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of theprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is thatfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of theturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It islack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem.

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger   economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a   lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than   just a "we have the money, why not?" approach.Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is notwasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) billsto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would bespent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of fundinghigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund variousfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to thedefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC tofund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-Europeancooperation.Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste ofmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count asinvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look atthe size of that multiplier :->).Nick Haines nickh@cmu.edu

Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the   tanks big enough.Our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and atelescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets forsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ieduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty muchcontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets alsoneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, andflip the payload around to look at the Sun.We have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speakingonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose howmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They haveextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas quantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I'll try to get youin touch with our ground crew people.Cheers,Craig--DON'T DRINK SOAP! DILUTE DILUTE! OK!

The training course will discuss the applications ofsatellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energyand the environment.The training course, organised for the benefit of francophoneAfrican experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European SpaceAgency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible forcoordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensingsatellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, westernand central Africa, and three regional African centres, willattend the two-week session. The course will focus on remotesensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1data.The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radarinstrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensingmissions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year2000. The aim of the training course is to increase thepotential of experts using the practical applications of radarremote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energyand the environment, with particular emphasis on applicationsto geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.The education and practical training programme wasdeveloped jointly by the United Nations and ESA. Thefacilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers andinformation documents for the training course, will beprovided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course willinclude high-level experts from other European and Africanorganisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds forthe training course are being provided by the United NationsTrust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; theprimary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.A similar training course is being planned for Latin Americanexperts.

Space ScienceDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sailproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen togenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out atthe meeting. Here goes : The Microlight Solar Sail-------------------------1. IntroductionThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure ofsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such avehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than mostpeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram persquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminizedfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' typespacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hteidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.2.DesignRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: atiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purelybe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude controlmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on apanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed atEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and datagathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control andcommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surfaceof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost ofthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.3.MissionsThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amorgroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bitrate.b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobservedareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail toreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receivesunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm thatvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in theselocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunarbase, BTW]c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or cometnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craftcauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edgedtube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as anideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heatis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulatingcontainer.Contact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447Oxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England--------------------------------This guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project orseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you moreinformation.Andy--                                   ----------------------------------- Andy Jonathan J.

It's more likely that the Moon will neverbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has nomaterials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroidsand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in lowgrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat sink capacity could offer some military utility for "high ground" militaryweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor activity in the global scope of things.Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to preventcalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it'stoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factoriesthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Lunahas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbitalsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offersa source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light andheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravitywells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtuallyignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have todeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much moreexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use theeasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a fewcenturies, if not much longer.Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radioastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the siteof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system fordefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first isunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are goodenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe forconventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from abunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges.

Forexample, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and ifmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economygets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.as along as they could be used, someone would keep buggingcongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them peskyscientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  I've heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"spacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believethat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.This safe mode could be a program routine which causes thespacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission cancontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back tothe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when thespacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could beprepared if necessary.  As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact isbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.By making the time and signal location generally known, perhapssomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept thedata even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft whichcould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going toplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,exiting the solar system, etc).   Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,etc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case theirspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion ofthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo couldhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission"drift" phase.So any holes in all this?/~~~(-: James T.

Massive amounts of regolith wouldhave to be processed.This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moonas a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn'tcontent with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust,average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though themarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; "high-Ti" basalts (Apollo 11and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched intitanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, andsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over theworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  Ifeven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Tibasalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the mooncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of theore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores beingmined today).Paul F.

For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth,you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specificimpulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dryweight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer.A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand orbirdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would bethe payload.  I am sure the whole project is well withinthe capability of the amateur rocketry community.It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reductionof Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'.Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussedhere: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 yearon the moon, $1 million for the first erradication ofan orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000for the first person to bring it down, and I am surethere are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers,or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.Of course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler.(Either the solution Gerald Bull would apply--the useof a large caliber gun; or the solution which was appliedto Gerald Bull--the use of a small caliber gun.)-- David M.

Humphrey, AddisonWesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels ofsoftware process maturity are:1. Initial2. Repeatable3. Defined4. Managed5. OptimizingThe levels are approximately characterized as follows:1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical   basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will   take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will   be.  Most software production is at this level.2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project   management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects   are planned in detail, and there is software configuration   management and quality assurance.3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is   consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a   rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,   and typically a `software engineering process group' within the   project.4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered   and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this   information. Software quality is measured and has goals.5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts   are effective and certified.Nick Haines nickh@cmu.edu

Also keep in mind that it was*not* achieved through the use of sophisticated tools, but ratherthrough a 'brute force and ignorance' attack on the problem during theChallenger standdown - they simply threw hundreds of people at it anddid the whole process by hand.  I would not consider receiving a 'Warning'status on systems which are not yet in use would detract much (ifanything) from such a rating -- I'll have to get the latest copy ofthe guidelines to make sure (they just issued new ones, I think).Also keep in mind that the SEI levels are concerned primarily withcontrol of the software process; the assumption is that awell controlled process will produce good software.  Also keep in mindthat SEI Level 5 is DAMNED HARD.

Fred is basicallycorrect:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstakingcare.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman citedthe software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (Healso noted that the software people were starting to feel managementpressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get thingsright for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failureduring those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure.As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be countedon one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software.Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by theexperimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care.(None of the experimenters could afford it.)-- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

Spaceflight is NOT in this position.The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the longtransocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't tofund these as long as something was known about the potential for profitat the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private.But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amountof money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop,and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you askme for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, Ican't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded byexisting space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, andwe are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industrieswill be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested tostart them, etc.--  Keith Mancus    <mancus@butch.jsc.nasa.gov>                           | N5WVR           <mancus@sweetpea.jsc.nasa.gov>                        | "Black powder and alcohol, when your states and cities fall,          |  when your back's against the wall...." -Leslie Fish                  |

Like fuelfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if thecontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't beworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapestheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If Idon't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about alow cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A GeneralDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upperstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering twounmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9billion for the US share.I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet thatits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metrictonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crewhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes forthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* beable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoorseats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (orcollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's roundthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 tonpayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, twoLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for ayear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way ofdelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyonehave a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables andequipment would weigh?And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discardedto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for theDC-1.All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on themoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the firstnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a mannedmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables fromlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Findsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goalmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appearedto win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scaryabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'dlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was anEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases onthe cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the humanbody produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solarflares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine.

My impression would  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.

In order to turn thespacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will beavailable, or you need to retrain a new team.Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed.Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set.Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a "standby" mode foruse in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is stillrequired to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance isrelatively cheap.Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenanceto stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin-stabilized control mode because it would require little power or maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from timeto time.In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.David W. @ GSFC

But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau) was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boostpayload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competingwith the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except nowI recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the earlyresults are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue their development. The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-Dwhich sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know aboutlaunch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches whichare probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake thingsup pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragilething and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support whilebolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road trackand erected on the pad?

The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter. You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized. It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally, the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi. That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions(when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching. The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaurdoes. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be done there........|> |> They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads |> (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course|> any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the|> US at great cost.

The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with providing centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill this idea. -- H.D.

However, theconcept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I suspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic benefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for ahuman powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economicbenefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developedand the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the equivalent amount of direct investment would.  A person who puts up $ X billionfor a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it donethan because they expect to make money off the deal.-- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu    "Find a way or make one."             -attributed to Hannibal

The magnitude of such accelerations heestimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may notbe a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was publishedin 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is verylong-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations infact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices ofcourse. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?Can this be extended to larger accelerations?Thanks is advance...-Amruth Laxman

So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, andother expenses you can owe more than what you made.BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe600.00 in federal taxes..

We grewup in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these weremiracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the punditshave told us - "you've lost it!"  The "me" generation is onlyliving on the accomplishments of the past.     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  Welisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Livinghistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tellof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe asGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle- to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousanddollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken onlyof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.Schriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that thebest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman andPoseidon ballistic missiles.     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listenedto your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. And we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Letme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetusbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatestengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Yourinsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporatedinto today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.     You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - asingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  Youadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as areall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  Youconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weldits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of aprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from thegeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinentalaviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a littleand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner whostarted this program for the SDI.     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't evenstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested alittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before theymoved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or morebefore putting the first "rubber on the road."  Max Hunter - youdidn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going totake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusableaerospace transportation is real.     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  sameteam here today but a few years to show through the StrategicDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in abouta year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled ourcommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the SovietUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscoredthe importance of our work in bringing about a new internationalrelationship.     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place theframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for thenext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  Thissummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for thefirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next threeyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use spacerapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  Andyes - we'll make a little money off it too!     Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years tobuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 ofspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of therocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts tocounter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap tothe final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't SaturnV's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extradollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbitalsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed theway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocketexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape theworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks athand!     This project is real.  The torch of American technologicalgreatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine isAmerican.  Let's go fly it!

Forproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage RocketTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How tolower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry forour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of atorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a newthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old thingsfrom past masters.     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so calledexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made nosense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president ofthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." Well Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are theseprinciples that SSRT defies?     Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you needa giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And itviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant forless than many billions of dollars.     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach ussome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not aSaturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years todemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remindus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was asenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of asingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build alittle, Test a little.     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  Wedidn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just changeevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- TheALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would betterknown as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn't spend alot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's thelast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn'ttake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted ofone very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by thethreat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair ifit ran over cost or schedule.     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind itsonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and stepsthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  Buteach step should follow the same principles -- a small managementteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modestbudget.     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:(See charts)     I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the lastgeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950'sand 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope thatcan't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least wecould do is soft-land on Earth!     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build alittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordableand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers amongyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermalprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to landhorizontally, etc, etc.     I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  Youbring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we dowhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ notincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have yourprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, anddecade long programs.]     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter's idea -- Any Takers?

From: dmcaloon@tuba.calpoly.edu (David McAloon)Subject: PLANETS STILL: IMAGES ORBIT BY ETHER TWISTOrganization: California Polytechnic State University, San Luis ObispoLines: 234 ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary, ether sucking structures, AND why we observe "orbital" motion!!  Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.   I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the earth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!  1  I dream like this: ether based reality   The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the latticesboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. (non-spinning lattice = "dark matter")  The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but its "foot print" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])    The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is itself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The "orbit" of theearth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged aroundby the sun's ether feild.  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and "distance" apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because the "path" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half turn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a "j" hook at the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.   With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as "earth's" shadow upon it, and at other times totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they look about the same size?   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S E       /     \                M    |      |      OR                M             \ _ _ /                                S                                    The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rateof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating "turntable view" of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the day. Try and draw that "earth shadow.") Its only the moon's image which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.  "Light-Years" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be essentially happening now. The "piece" of light may have experienced many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just might carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ billion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card for Pentium!)  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I could get with my machine's receiver next to it.    If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what they did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where did the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then die)  Warning about writing to the past:I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by "advising" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, existing only on the wind.   MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls whose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back)  Accepting rides to the past:Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own course of history, none the wiser.  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. But he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.   How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, our money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?   In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, "its chaos!" They said, "no, its order." He defined chaos as that which is he was not able to control.  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no language. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and need a lot less sleep.  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that they aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life.   Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was right, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over your destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality in which you don't want to be a part of.   I don't claim to be the first to think these things, its just that the others could have been 'pruned' from our path. Maybe these thoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time, after him.

(Delta Clippermight be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are lessambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)

In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think.I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost90 degrees.u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured.Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun.The spring equinox occurs at a=0.L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day).On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees)L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.Computation:Define the auxiliary angles p and q by:sin p = sin a sin zcos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)Conclusion:L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees)L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)Wait!  But what is h?The cutoff function h is defined as follows:h (s) = s    if  |s| < 1      = 1    if   s > 1      = -1   if   s < 1As an interesting exercise, plot L versus a.   The graph will showshow the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year.Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles.Compare the behavior of the function at locations above and belowthe arctic circle.--Rouben Rostamian                          Telephone: 410-455-2458Department of Mathematics and Statistics  e-mail:University of Maryland Baltimore County   bitnet: rostamian@umbc.bitnetBaltimore, MD 21228, USA                  internet: rouben@math.umbc.edu

Thissummarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held inSeville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised bythe European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre forthe Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).OLYMPUS has been particularly useful :-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few       examples.-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was theworld's largest telecommunications satellite; and no othersatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining fourdifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to someof the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite isgiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques orservices; over the past four years some 200 companies andorganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learningorganisation.As the new technologies and services tested by theseOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they thenmake use of operational satellites such as those ofEUTELSAT.OLYMPUS utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994,when the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches theend of its design life.

But even after the colonies revolted or where given independance theBritish engaged in very lucrative trading with the former colonies.Five years after the American Revolution England was still the largestUS trading partner.

We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger   in and of it self did not uncover flaws.2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is   not dependent on "sophisticated tools"  (CASE tools?).  However, tools   cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle   Language) is somewhat limited.3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated "Level 5" by a NASA team.   This group generates 20-40 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA.4.

Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the factthat far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For muchof the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down theindustry.

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was receivedproperly.2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) testand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test wereperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meterantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysisis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailedinformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degreesto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalancemeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DCmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) andcurrently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent withthe model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.6.

I can't imagine the FAA allowing>people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes.>Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down.Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to beone of the following:a) An employee of a government agency.b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved inresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in constructionand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on thelocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraftwithin the operating radius around the launch site.- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace thatunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over thewestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popularsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback isfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an "F" motor are exempt frommost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, SubpartC, for details.As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typicalrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carryeither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launchesin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.>And no, I'm not going to even think of buying one.  I'm not that crazy.Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rocketsfor information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everythingbigger) rocket hobbies.

If you really wantspeed, consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile (still inservice as the core of the Delta launcher) shipped to the USAF lessthan 18 months after the development go-ahead.One of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the beliefthat you can't build a launcher without taking ten years and spendingbillions of dollars.

(alveolus?)    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough    gas per unit volume.

As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble..Basically find a country who wants to go into space, but can't for soem reasonor another, but who will give you a "home".. Such as Saudia Arabia orwhatever..There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN, got to them andoffer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy, but. is it..Also once you have the means to mine the moon (or whatever) then just do it.The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else, they willnot care.. If your worried about the US, do the same thing..Why be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have manyother things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or whatever..Basically what I am saying is where is that drive of yeasteryears to go alittle bit farther out, to do jus ta  little bit more, and to tell the crown topiss off..

"In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary toformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possibleto accomplish the mission objectives."Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessionsthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integratedsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand aloneunderwater training "runs" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will bemade based on actual training experience during the months prior to themission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flightwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will includespacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between theactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks atthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,Huntsville, Ala.Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gainingfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand theexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers andtrainers.Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built withgrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At thattime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may havebecome necessary.- end -     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

But thanksto major design refinements implemented in recent months, JPL'sSpace Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) -- a major projectconsidered to be in trouble a couple of years ago -- is "aliveand well," according to Project Scientist Michael Werner.     A lighter spacecraft, revised orbit and shorter mission haveadded up to a less expensive project with "tremendous scientificpower" and a bright future, said Werner.     Designed as a follow-up to the highly successful InfraredAstronomical Satellite (IRAS) and Cosmic Background Explorer(COBE) missions, SIRTF -- a cryogenically cooled observatory forinfrared astronomy from space -- is scheduled for launch in 2000or 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled.     IRAS' pioneering work in space-based infrared astronomy 10years ago allowed astronomers to view the Milky Way as neverbefore and revealed, among other things, 60,000 galaxies and 25comets. It provided a sky survey 1,000 times more sensitive thanany previously available from ground-based observations. COBE hasmeasured the infrared and microwave background radiation on largeangular scales, and revealed new facts about the early universe.     But to illuminate SIRTF's potential, Jim Evans, JPL'smanager of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics Pre-Projects,recently said that the project is "1,000 to 1 million times morecapable than IRAS," based on technological advances in infrareddetector arrays.     However, despite the enormous strides in infraredexploration SIRTF promised, and the fact that it was cited as thehighest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s(by the National Academy of Sciences), it took a "diet or die"directive from NASA Headquarters last year to keep the projectgoing, according to Werner.     The project is now known as Atlas SIRTF, based on the keyfactor in its new design: The satellite will orbit the suninstead of the Earth, permitting the use of an Atlas rocketlaunch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier Titan. "Themain advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of yourlaunch capability for boosting the payload -- you don't have tocarry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit," Werner said.The other advantage to a solar orbit, he said, is that "it's in abetter thermal environment, away from the heat of the Earth."     Additional major changes in SIRTF's redesign includeshortening the mission from five to three years and building aspacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the originalplan -- Atlas SIRTF will weigh 2,470 kilograms (5,400 pounds)compared to Titan SIRTF's 5,500 kilograms (12,100 pounds).     All of that adds up to "a less stressful launchenvironment," Werner said, and a cost savings of more than $200million for the launch, in addition to increased savings in thedesign of the smaller, less massive spacecraft.     Werner said SIRTF's redesign came as a result of Congress'telling NASA "you're trying to do too many things. If you want usto support SIRTF, which is a good project, develop a plan to seehow it fits into (NASA's) overall strategy."     Shortly thereafter, SIRTF was named as NASA's highestpriority "flagship" scientific mission by the interdisciplinarySpace Sciences Advisory Committee, in addition to the blessingfrom the National Academy of Sciences.     While the spacecraft and its instruments required descopingto keep the project alive, SIRTF's major scientific contributionalways promised to come about from its advanced infrared detectorarrays, which will allow images to be developed "tens ofthousands of times faster" than before, according to Evans.     "Up until a couple of years ago," Werner said, "all infraredastronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arraysof individually assembled detectors. Since then, the Departmentof Defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens orhundreds of thousands of detectors, rather than just a few, andthose are very well suited for use on SIRTF."     Werner noted that in addition to dealing with budgetpressures, Congress is currently watching NASA projects with aneye out for any "technological spinoff."     "On that question, I think we have some things to say," hesaid, "because the detectors we're using are straight off variousmilitary developments. Also, SIRTF will be built by the U.S.aerospace industry, and it's a real technological and engineeringchallenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project.     "SIRTF will be used by the entire astronomical community,"Werner added, but the revised three-year mission "puts a premiumon observing time. We have to educate the user community anddevelop a program that involves early surveys and quickturnaround of the data."     Werner said the downsizing of the project required areduction in scope and complexity of SIRTF's three instruments --the infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera and multibandimaging photometer. However, these reductions will only result inlosses of efficiency rather than capability, he said.     The project hopes to start a "Phase B" activity in 1995,which will provide a detailed concept for development and design.Building the hardware would begin about two years later.     Projected cost estimates, Evans said, are $850 million-$950million.     "I am very optimistic about SIRTF," he said. "It willprovide a tremendous return for the investment."     Werner added that an additional benefit from the projectwill be the "enrichment of our intellectual and culturalenvironment. People on the street are very interested inastronomy ... black holes, the possibility of life on otherplanets, the origin of the universe ... and those are the kind ofquestions SIRTF will help answer."                              ###     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

On a tour hosted by JPL Chief Scientist Dr. Moustafa Chahineand Merle McKenzie, manager of the International Affairs Office,Hawking visited a variety of facilities, met with Lab DirectorDr. Edward Stone and various project scientists and managers, andfelt "like royalty," he said. Hawking, whose theories attempt toexplain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternatedimensions, wanted to re-visit JPL, he explained, "because whileI'm most interested in those things in space that are fartheraway, I know that here is where the first steps are taken."     Hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduatestudents and his aides, began the tour in von Karman Auditorium,as David Evans, deputy assistant Lab director in the Office ofFlight Projects, and Dr. Arden Albee, Mars Observer's projectscientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects.     Voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paidto a gold plate with a series of engraved images. Shouldextraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, Evans noted,they would find a variety of images that would explain somethingof Earth. The professor asked if we were still communicating withthe spacecraft, and Evans affirmed that we are.     Using a model of Mars Observer, Albee spent several minutesdescribing the project and the spacecraft's features. In answerto a question from Hawking, Chahine described a proposeddrag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, "it's onlya concept." Chahine, who had met Hawking at Caltech about fiveyears before, described the professor as "a living miracle of thepower of the brain. He's miraculous, and he has such a good senseof humor."     The next stop, a demonstration on scientific datavisualization in Section 384's Digital Image Animation Lab,entertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned gogglesto view 3-D images of Mars. Project Scientist Dr. Eric De Jongshowed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently beendiscovered in orbit close to Jupiter. Hawking was curious aboutits composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, heasked several questions on their interpretation.     Norman Haynes, ALD, Office of Telecommunications and DataAcquisition, briefed the professor on the Space Flight OperationsFacility, and then Hawking spoke with Stone.     The day ended with two technical discussions of particularinterest to the professor. Technical Group Leader Dr. FrankEstabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist describeda three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way.Then planetary astronomer Dr. Richard Terrile explained thephilosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection.     The Hawking party, which had been visiting SouthernCalifornia for five weeks, was headquartered at Caltech, andplanned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Labtour. Upon departing, the Cambridge-based scientist promisedChahine that he would return to JPL for another visit.                          ###     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

The meetings were part of "Space VLBI Week" held at JPL inearly March and were intended to maintain cooperation betweeninternational space agencies participating in the development ofthe U.S. Space VLBI Project, a recently approved JPL flightproject set for launch in 1995.     U.S. Space VLBI will utilize two Earth-orbiting spacecraft-- the Japanese VSOP (VLBI Space Observing Program) satellitewith its 8-meter radio telescope, and a Russian RADIOASTRON10-meter satellite. Both spacecraft will team up withground-based radio telescopes located around the world to createa radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radiotelescope observing power by a factor of 10.     Japan's VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit toconduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraftwill exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratoryradio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target forroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radiotelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source objectwhile within view on Earth.     According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL's project manager for theU.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permitJapan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radiointerferometry, to establish working relationships with the radioastronomy communities that will be vital during the complexobservations required by the Space VLBI project.     "One of our main activities is developing the methodologyfor international coordination, because the two spacecraftsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations whileusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the samecelestial objects," said Smith.     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSNfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located inJapan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network ofground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks andhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward theinformation to a correlator located at the National RadioAstronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator willcombine and process data, then make it available to missioninvestigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope createdby the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers withbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before byground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take acloser look at distant objects in space.     "There is a long history of radio astronomy usingground-based telescopes," said Smith. "What we intend to do is toextend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to lookdeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and otheractive radio sources to understand what drives those things wehave seen so far with radio astronomy."     Smith noted that if one examines "the active galacticnuclei, you'll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater thanlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greaterthan you would expect."     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may belocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuelthe jets. Smith hopes that "by using Space VLBI to look furtherinto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved."     Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders andtransmitters, are now being tested in the United States, andJapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later thisyear. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists andengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBACorrelator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odddata patterns that will originate from the more than 20ground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with theJapanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held atJPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that thepolitical uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country'sparticipation in the project.     "Nothing is ever smooth," he said, "but the Russians havebeen incredibly open with us. We always anticipated somelikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factorsbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping thesethings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level."     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more atstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to ascience mission.     "The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, sinceinternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,"he said.     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officialslook at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcasethe technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highlyregarded Mach V launch vehicle.     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such anambitious project, JPL's Smith is satisfied that planning for theSpace VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial andpolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.     "Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, andif either falls out, we would still have something with theother. By themselves, both spacecraft are independent,scientifically exciting missions."                           ###     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

From: kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.govSubject: Space Station Redesign, JSC Alternative #4Organization: NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]Lines: 71I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outliningone of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered inCrystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and canbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail atmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.Mark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on theoutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback withintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from filegeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of muchof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  Thewhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station RemonteManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrustingcan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the massproperties of the Station change during assembly.The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily becauseit can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strongpart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces arelimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of thedocking system.The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additionallaunch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've neverhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventualde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent theresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit fromimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy aKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminatingthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providingfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as thenucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control MomentGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be usedfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit systemwhich can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform acontrolled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like wedid with Skylab).The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could beused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravityon humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage devicefor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted onone of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF workdone to date.Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumorsI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiterseems more likely.Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design;you should see his notes in the GIF files.  Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these foranon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

Grazing in a couple of databases recently,  I found that Japan has some optical capabilitiesalong this line, and also uses a radar designed for other purposesfor orbital debris surveys (it isn't clear whether the radar can determine orbital elements for the objects it detects).

RPN: AIAA PAPER 90-1343     Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross section are determined from a series of observations made with a high-power VHF Doppler radar (MU radar) of Japan. An automated data processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail echoes or lightning atmospherics. Although the results are preliminary, they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar      <----observations using a much higher frequency. It is found that the     <----collision frequency of a Space Station of 1 km x 1 km size at an altitude of 500 km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as once per two years. Monitoring of the MU radar antenna pattern by Satellite Ohzora (EXOS-C)SATO, T.; INOOKA, Y.; FUKAO, S. (Kyoto Univ., Japan); KATO, S.Kyoto Univ., Uji (Japan). Radio Atmospheric Science Center.In International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program.Handbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 pPublication Date: Jun. 1986      As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere troposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar features an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal division/combination are performed at a low signal level using electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement and results are discussed.Equatorial radar systemFUKAO, SHOICHIRO;  TSUDA, TOSHITAKA; SATO, TORU; KATO, SUSUMU(Kyoto University, Uji, Japan)(COSPAR, IAGA, SCOSTEP, et al., Plenary Meeting, 27th,Workshops and Symposium on the Earth's Middle Atmosphere,Espoo, Finland, July 18-29, 1988) Advances in Space Research(ISSN 0273-1177), vol. 10, no. 10, 1990, p. 151-154.     A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent scatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 km altitude is now being designed in Japan. The radar will be built in Pontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (0.03 deg N, 109.29 deg E). The system is a 47-MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array configuration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan, which has been in successful operation since 1983. It will have a PA product of about 3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m (P = average transmitter power, A = effective antenna aperture) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of the MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam steering within 20 deg from the zenith. As is the case of the MU radar, a variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of the radar controller. A brief description of the system configuration is presented.

However, the rumors>I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter>seems more likely.Yo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the "External Tank" and"Wingless Orbiter" options have been deleted from the SSF redesignoptions list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reportsthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals havebeen dropped, such as using the "giant external fuel tanks usedin launching space shuttles," and building a "station aroundan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed."Currently, there are three options being considered, as presentedto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported intoday's Times).Option "A" - Low Cost Modular ApproachThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supportingthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC andReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respectiveteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of thisoption are:  -  Uses "Bus-1", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this     for the Air Force.  -  A "Power Station Capability" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle     flies in an "arrow mode" to optimize the microgravity environment.     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power     source for 30 day missions.  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and     add another 20 kW of power  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return     Vehicle).Option "B" - Space Station Freedom DerivedThe Option "B" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which wehave all come to know and love :)This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available foruse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option "A"). Also, the number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,for both options "A" and "B".The build-up occurs in six phases:  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when     it visits.  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).  -  A "Two Fault Tolerance Capability" is achieved after 14 flights,     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the     assembly in 24 flights.Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, with the exception of the data management system, which has majorchanges.Option C - Single Core Launch Station.This is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diametercylinder that's 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines onthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocketmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against    micrometeroid & orbital debris)  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)  - 7 berthing ports  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet    (twice the volume of skylab).  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors  - 10 kW of housekeeping power  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)  - increased crew time for utilization  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module

Some of what I would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife.  The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains one weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a lastbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. Regards, Wm. Hathaway Baltimore MD

I've transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no meansinfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is granted to copy this without restriction.Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing asingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled "Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions" here at the University ofIllinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories anddetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he isnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the detailsof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hopethey aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you willbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  Themain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume thatthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but Idid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boostersand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelsonshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:                  ______3 G         /|   /      |           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly           /  | /        |   good.  The big difference is that the lines2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as       /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long.1 G   /                 |                        |                        |0 G                     |             ^          ^           ~100 sec    ~400 secAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel theaccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so itsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer enginesbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cutout entirely.The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimedfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges ofair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to that desired.Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than    all at once?A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?A:  Can't tell us.  "Read Aviation Leak."  He also apparently had a good     propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protectingnational security or MD protecting their own interests?The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitchup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphsof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would haveabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about 60 degrees south latitude.I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about thataspect of the flight profile.-- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu    "Find a way or make one."             -attributed to Hannibal

I've transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no meansinfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is granted to copy this without restriction.Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at aninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament andInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because thecompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped thathis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tongato visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thoughtthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronoussatellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot ofslots.The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and CarlHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinionssupporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from 70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in theworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and the Pacific Rim. RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a taxhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, tofill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would havecost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the waythat people operate.  For example "everybody can sell you everything."  Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are theonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a costof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternbergsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos wasout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  Heagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessionsbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has builtabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented thatsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honestpeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At thispoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion onboth siberians and midwesterners :-)Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite thatwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellitesthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  Thiscompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can giveyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they aregetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into placenow.Tidbits:*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not bigbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, exceptthat "we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier."*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launchwithin 9 months.*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirementfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says issort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worriedpartly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvaryingmonolith.  Italy gets a new government "every two weeks" but we don't worry because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing whatreally goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transferingmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the "equivalent" value in rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrianbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so thatthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same typeof satellites, which was rather reassuring.*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitivetechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites havea lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites comparewell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newertechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of datehardware.-- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu    "Find a way or make one."             -attributed to Hannibal

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions.However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faintones to be consistent with being equally dense for as faras we can see--it is as if they are all contained withina finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at thecenter.  (These measurements are statistical, and you canalways hide a sufficiently small number of a differenttype of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assumingthat there is only one population of GRBs).The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the centerof the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact centerof are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of cometsway beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placingGRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies tobe released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud modelstend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane ofthe Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center(for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if theyare Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years inradius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the AndromedaGalaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)

Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, takingappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so anyof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of thegalaxy.          Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from thevarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, eitherPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on ourcatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropicdistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs ofhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we aresampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, Isuppose you are saying, "Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside thedisk."  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less aninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay outto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors detect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane fromthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mileaway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of hisarbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybefind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.          I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As Isaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (shorttimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type ofbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be boundto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely seenot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none ofthese characteristics.                  I think that's all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knowssomething that I don't know, by all means correct me.  I had the honor oftaking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of thesedifferent distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possibledistribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars,black holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.   It's a funfield.

You also getto worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost isdone and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed forthe duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination fromthrusters and the like).The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do thereboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, wellsuited to precisely this sort of job.

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.    In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to $450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward revision in Department of Defense launch plans."                              Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very successful in regaining international market share in the satellite business.    Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually publishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.    Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected.)    It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] 2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.    The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation, and not yet final.    The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  Under this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to occur within 40 days of the request.     [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping MDC as a viable commerical launch company.     However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.    Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III program in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and Congress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]  3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral images of the Earth.    [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists, agricultural planners, and urban planners.     It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.    There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so.]                  4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT"    Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent analyst's report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical 95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-generating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.    [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur program is back on track, this division will continue to show substantial losses.    In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company.]  5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade.    Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.    Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.    Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders. Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to about 3000 kg in GEO.    Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near-term transponders.    One of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.    [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit.   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service, but only from established point A to established point B. To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points, and while there are improved network solutions, installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars.     For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic.    Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals.    And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over-supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.    We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches.]6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT    The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules.     In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call.    Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.    Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used in the launch.   [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.     At the time of writing this column, some of the initial investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four different communications channels were in use during the test. After the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch.     As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they do with commercial aircraft problems).     I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated.] 7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called 'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.    [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.    This one's a little different in that they are offering variants of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing.]8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.    [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development.     This might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs?  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment?     Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor launch vehicle as well as from the US.    [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on system).     This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to find any other European development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware.    Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.    What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system.    It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract.] 10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main alternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the Swedish satellite was not specified.    [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series rockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a 225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.     PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and 2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors.     PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.    The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real hardware.] 11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the satellite's communications channels.     [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 M) through 2006.     I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures.    The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-2", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing Hong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed.    In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This is just another indicator to add to the list.] 12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by 1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by 2000.                                    [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry, specifically including space activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market.    As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.    South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-monitoring micro-satellite.    This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors.   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort, funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the Korean peninsula.          In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).     This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade.] 13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

This column's already full?  And I still have bunches of commercial space developments to report on.  As I said at the start of this, column there's been a lot of interesting happenings - but I'll have to put them into the next issue.     Looking ahead, I've got several articles in the works on new happenings with Iridium and the LEO communications satellite market, more news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on the market, new international commercial space ventures,  and other interesting developments.

Box 2452                                         Seal Beach, CA 90740-1452
From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.orgSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)X-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993Lines: 82   Two developments have brought these type of activities back tothe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed fromthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Bannerreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TVcommercial, as filmed from the Mir.   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, thesame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestogabooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "EnvironmentalBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of theUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of theLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "EnvironmentalBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible formaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone readingsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth'sdelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head ofSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimumexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth'satmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,it will release ozone-building components that will literallyreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitorthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burnsup and "adds to the ozone supply."   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least severalmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMIestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people whowatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is beingpromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996Summer Olympics in Atlanta.  But back to Brian's questions:>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild>idea" stage or does it have real funding?      See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (myestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus$10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming totailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times foroptimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back uponsomeone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicatedlaunch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this aswell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the useof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think thelegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional lightpollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legalchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positiveaspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make theadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would changepositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate thespace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like anidiot?)   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a lowenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it wouldonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and beforedawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible justafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the timeof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might stillbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  Therewere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestogaadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was foronly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious fundingfor this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around lookingfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But Iam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.     And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please bemy guest.  I don't have posting privileges to that area (or at leastI don't THINK I do...). ------------------------------------------------------------------- Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor--- Maximus 2.01wb
From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.orgSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)X-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993Lines: 81Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild>idea" stage or does it have real funding?      Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of theCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:  SPACE ADVERTISING    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is verycommon practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on thespace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the(very prominent) logos on its side of   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and   - the GPS/Navstar program office   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that onlyorganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on theside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, puttinga 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the camerasis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in myopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle hasrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentialsfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing largeadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know ofseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked atputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payloadbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", inthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firmsparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums forthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (Forexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting aDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameraswould scan past it.)  ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowedto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoecompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the lastOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items fromparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, forexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of theBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launchvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMETrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisementson the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie "The LastAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participatingorganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on themain fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its boosterrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth forone month.  A concept for this advertising display was published inSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, istalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea hecreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertisingsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for thespace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space onthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not usehis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA andreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launchis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of theadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program iscoming from NASA.)  ORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction forsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and RobertHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Severaldifferent potential projects have been developed, although none havebeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "EiffelII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture inorbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.

(Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster wasprobably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halopopulation should show anisotropy (a local disk population isruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy youhave to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanismof getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should startto see for example the Andromeda's bursters.The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source withthe right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (henceisotropy) and the edge is "the edge of the Universe" ;-)If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron starcolliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then gettingthe spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.If we know anything about physics at that level,the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmicstrings, wrong spectrum for one thing.The situation is further complicated by recent claims thatthere are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NSthey'd actually probably fit relatively easily into theNS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering   hyperspace :-)   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.If you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...*  Steinn Sigurdsson   Lick Observatory      **  steinly@lick.ucsc.edu"standard disclaimer"  **  The laws of gravity are very,very strict**  And you're just bending them for your own benefit - B.B. 1988*

Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,including a young man who will identify himself only as "Bill" andclaims to be the "MS-iah".Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speakhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.

TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.     TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The 2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).     Further info on TRIAD, DISCOS, etc. can be found in "Spacecraft Design Innovations in the APL Space Department," Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, Vol. 13, No. 1 (1992).                                                      --Eric Hoffman

In fact, be-fore BATSE, having this widely separated "Interplanetary Network" was theonly sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannotlocate a burst (except to say "It's somewhere in the field of view.").  Withtwo detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detectorto narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors,one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of theselocations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the sky), voila, you have an error box.BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination,but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, liketo comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde-pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.You did touch on something that you didn't mean to, though.  Some believe(in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seenin a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.

Kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  Did youknow about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia,they have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can preventyou from running light AC motors, like air conditioners and Vacuums.In practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.I say:What I'm objecting to here is a floating billboard that, presumably,would move around in the sky.  I, for one, am against legislatingat all.

From: mcelwre@cnsvax.uwec.eduSubject: LARSONIAN Astronomy and PhysicsOrganization: University of Wisconsin Eau ClaireLines: 552                      LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics               Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists           CLAIM to be looking for a "Unified Field Theory" in which all           of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single           set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically           IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he           calls the "Reciprocal System", is built on two fundamental           postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of           space and time:                    (1) "The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE           component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE           UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME."                    (2) "The physical universe conforms to the relations of           ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are           ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN."                    From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE           Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of           translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward           SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light           (which Larson called "UNIT VELOCITY" and "THE NATURAL           DATUM").                      At each step in the development, Larson was able to           MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the           REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles           [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star           clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white           dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET           DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY           BURSTS).                          And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,           Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility           and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of           matter.                All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy           complex mathematics, in his books.               BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson                         The following is a complete list of the late Physicist           Dewey B. Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL           UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe.  Some of the early           books are out of print now, but still available through           inter-library loan.                    "The Structure of the Physical Universe" (1959)                    "The Case AGAINST the Nuclear Atom" (1963)                   "Beyond Newton" (1964)                    "New Light on Space and Time" (1965)                    "Quasars and Pulsars" (1971)                    "NOTHING BUT MOTION" (1979)                     [A $9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the $8.3 BILLION "Super                                                             Collider".]                     [The last four chapters EXPLAIN chemical bonding.]               "The Neglected Facts of Science" (1982)                     "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" (1984)                    [FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical                                                            mysteries.]                      "BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER" (1988)               All but the last of these books were published by North           Pacific Publishers, P.O. Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and           should be available via inter-library loan if your local           university or public library doesn't have each of them.                Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available           from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS),           1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the           organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.            They have other related publications, including the quarterly           journal "RECIPROCITY".                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                   Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer           (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he           died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in           Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He           developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE           chemical properties based only on the elements used.                    Larson's lack of a fancy "PH.D." degree might be one           reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is           NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider           to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same           time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX           physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,           well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC           ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                     Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally           test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.            He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER           researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in           many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                    A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX           physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking           for a "unified field theory" that works, but have been           IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                    "Modern physics" does NOT explain the physical universe           so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of           quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who           agree.  And remember that "epicycles", "crystal spheres",           "geocentricity", "flat earth theory", etc., ALSO once SEEMED           to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                        Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,           was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or           still is) President of Larson's organization, "THE           INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE", and Editor of           their quarterly Journal "RECIPROCITY".  He moved to           Minneapolis after retiring.               "Super Collider" BOONDOGGLE!                         I am AGAINST contruction of the "Superconducting Super           Collider", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS           WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of "scientific"           value.                    Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the           comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist           Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY           particles ("mesons", "hyperons", ALLEGED "quarks", etc.)           which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,           Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are           CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly           disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible           with their environment.                    A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a           few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not           seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE           CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                    Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3           BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for           this WASTED money?!                         Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed           location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some           kind of "fire ants" eating the insulation off underground           cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water           with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of           the "Supercollider"?!                              Naming the "Super Collider" after Ronald Reagon, as           proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be           named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                 LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                         In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of           opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more           to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the           photons of which they are made, in relation to the           vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,           which Larson calls "Unit Velocity" and the "Natural Datum".                     In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of           MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,           the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their           respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each           other.                      In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical           universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension           of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our           MATERIAL half.                  LARSONIAN Relativity                         The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury           has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the           rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this           advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational           perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,           etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to           help "prove" Einstein's "General Theory of Relativity".                    But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results           CLOSER to the 43 seconds than "General Relativity" can, by           INSTEAD using "SPECIAL Relativity".  In one or more of his           books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH           ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                    Larson TOTALLY REJECTED "General Relativity" as another           MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of "Special           Relativity", including the parts about "mass increases" near           the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on           doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than           1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,           although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                     In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead           of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured           from our material half of the physical universe.  The one           dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low           relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are           NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and           the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.           [Larson often used the term "COORDINATE TIME" when writing           about this.]                         In regard to "mass increases", it has been PROVEN in           atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near           the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is           ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists           are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,           mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is           actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS           BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.            The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward           SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of           the so-called "Big Bang" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL           FANTASY).                                                             THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book "THE UNIVERSE           OF MOTION", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific           Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456           pages, indexed, hardcover.                    It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL           UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that           author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                    It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical           mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and           multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of           the "3-degree" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white           dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                    It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL           looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with           OPEN MINDS!                    The following is an example of his Theory's success:           In his first book in 1959, "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL           UNIVERSE", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING           GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding           them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's           comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he           had an immediate related explanation for them also.                GAMMA-RAY BURSTS               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching           their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were           originally thought to originate from "neutron stars" in the           disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in           Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions           uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT           correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of           directional coincidence).                    Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by           the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of           his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", published in 1984, the           gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the           ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls           the "Cosmic Sector".  Because of the relationship between the           anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and           the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can           pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at           random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do           not correspond with known objects, and come from all           directions uniformly.)                    I wonder how close to us in space a source location           would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most           life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to           stop it!                    Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which           are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were           actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!               LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                         About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the           vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox           astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory           theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                    But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY           CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of           the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey           B. Larson.                    I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is           detailed in Chapter 7 of his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"           and in some of his other books.                    First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate           energy by "fusion".  A small fraction comes from slow           gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE           ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each           element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the           element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal           temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and           absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually           reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and           lighter elements.                    When the internal temperature of the star reaches the           destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I           SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron           present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms           and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some           of his books [better than I can].                    When the star explodes, the lighter material on the           outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less           than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center           portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to           the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The           explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and           it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN           SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                    Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall           back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown           outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The           material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a           WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward           the "MAIN SEQUENCE" from opposite directions on the H-R           Diagram.                    The chances of the two masses falling back into the           exact same location in space, making a single lone star           again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY           system, orbiting each other.                     According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE           DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the           material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown           outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to           MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about "degenerate matter", "neutron           stars", "black holes", etc..               LARSONIAN Solar System Formation               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the           exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single           white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL "mini" white dwarf           stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably           still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected           by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                      In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all           this information, and other principles of his comprehensive           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive           his own version of Bode's Law.                     "Black Hole" FANTASY!               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently           completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO "black           holes" merging together into a SINGLE "black hole", and           concluded that the new "black hole" would have MORE MASS than           the sum of the two original "black holes".                    Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED           FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of "black           holes", etc.!                    After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about           his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe, especially his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", it is           clear to me that "black holes" are NOTHING more than           MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is           just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the "black           hole" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want           to "prove" their theory.                        By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is           being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and           astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical           problem somehow makes him "wiser".  It does NOT!                    I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist           Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread           publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's           Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of           Unified Science).                                         ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection           with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to           find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                    I found a possible clue about why they might work on           pages 112-113 of the book "BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER", by           the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of           Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe.  I quote one paragraph:                    "As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development           of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally           different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.            The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It           was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book "NOTHING BUT           MOTION"] that there are physical processes in operation which           produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,           although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in           many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities           for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are           limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of           free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the           universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged           state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension           space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,           and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open           space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently           in the same location with respect to the natural reference           system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the           stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,           like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by           the progression of the natural reference system.  All           material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons           similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.            Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,           whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The           electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth           therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level."                          Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are           also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a           particular frequency (above the "unit" frequency) spinning           around one axis at a particular rate (below the "unit" rate).            ("Unit velocity" is the speed of light, and there are           vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,           according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the "above" and           "below" labels mixed up.]                    Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of           light!                    If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION           fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these           electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a           charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to           achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge           is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular           frequency (above the "unit" frequency) superimposed on the           rotation of the particle.)                      The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to           confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is           generated in clouds.           SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has           been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in           his first book "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE".                    It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,           and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call           "science" (or "physics", or "astronomy", etc.), as well as           the "scientific" literature and the "education" systems, to           TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                    Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many           things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such           as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                    Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY           discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,           in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles           of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses           at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and           elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a           worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

Could> someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is?The name is rather descriptive.  It's a command to the spacecraft that tellsit "If you don't hear from Earth after 264 hours, assume something is wrongwith your (the spacecraft) attitude, and go into a preprogrammed search modein an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth."The spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other.Earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft, and if everything is fine,there's no reason to send it any new information.  But from the spacecraft'spoint of view, no information from Earth could mean either everything isfine, or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition.  Just how longshould the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong andbegins to take corrective action?  That "how long" is the command loss timer.During relatively inactive cruise phases, the command loss timer can be setto rather long values.  In this case, Earth is telling Galileo "expect tohear back from us sometime within the next 264 hours".

Reading the cases of people who've tried the various thingsMr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) thosewho win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to theirclaim, and (2) those who lose.Consider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seencited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff.Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in theshow and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says thatan individual has to file a return.Mr. Newman took him up on it.  Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcastthe next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended topeople who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offerfor Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, andso Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.Mr. Schiff was correct, and so won.  So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against aclaim on the $100,000 reward.  However, his win had nothing to do withthe tax code.--Tim Smith

Brett himself has actually posted the data previously.What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percentincrease_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit (2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased.Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficitdeclined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keepsgrowing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowedpreviously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when yourincome exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Eachpresident, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time.Reagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.As a really rigorous aside to this thread.....During pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an"economist" who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictiveand based largely on population data. I don't know his name, but hisarguments were brilliant.  He confirmed, with data, what many of us knowwith common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with governmentpolicy, particularly "supply side" policy, since taxes do not "cause" economic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be explained by watching population waves roll through the years and create cycles.

They manage to make it up on other charges.Once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidneydialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of servicesto a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service.Otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than thevast expansion that has occurred.>>> Remember, the notion that you can lose a little on each treatment but>> make it up in volume is not good economics even in a free market. :) >>Then how do you explain why grocery stores routinely offer an>array of products at prices below cost?  Are not grocery stores>embedded in a relatively free market?Can you spell "loss leader?"  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do notattempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more ofit.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  But the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears thatprice controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion ofservice and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide comparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simplymake less on each treatment than they would have if the price had risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsdaypredictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restrictionof service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appearsthat in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.

Teel:Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that theIncome Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures forstopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for awhile now.Humbug.  Those letters don't provide "concrete proof" of anything at allin the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu-ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.Specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled thatincome tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have topay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with-out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  Thisissue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expectsomething squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case offederal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).Unless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material"concrete proof".There has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayersfinally given up as defeated?  Sure would like to hear theirreasons for disbelief at this point.Refutation??  Refutation of what?  You haven't made a case yet.  You'veposted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason tobelieve that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seemon the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that Ifeel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your argumentshave any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve suchstrange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings areapplicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appealto the Supreme Court.Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regularemployee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to payhis income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva-sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Courtwith a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totallyvoluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder whynot; why haven't you?Shall I conclude that the point has been received and theopposition has forfeited the field?With all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope,for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position ofauthority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit-ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.For that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you wouldbe looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought youtold us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with bigbanking interests since the 1938 "admiralty jurisdiction" coverup thing.Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the troubleto subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back intotheir burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the rightcombination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?Not only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway?Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by USofficials to classify you as a "14th Amendment federal citizen"?  Whenthe FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tellthem they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington,D.C., where they belong?Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which yousuggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like.If you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can justdeclare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roadswith no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your walletcan just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (withplenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).Sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all thisgarbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try-ing to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up injail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.Needless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my currentemployer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need tocare too much about US tax law.  I, on the other hand, am a "14th Amend-ment federal citizen", with a US passport to prove it, and plan to keepon filing Form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though I will probablynot owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusionand/or the foreign tax credit).-- Rich Wales <richw@mks.com>       //      Mortice Kern Systems Inc.

Doublejeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge.However, the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive forceor assault. They are NOW on trial for the DIFFERENT crime of violatingMr. King's civil rights. AS for the city and county or state trying you more than once, it most likely will not happen. This is because cities and stateshave separate laws governing behaviour. For example, in some states,it is an offence to carry marijuana, but not a city offence.

In practice,communism has "solved" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_productive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why therest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.  The mass butchery of "kulaks"in the USSR is a good instance of this.    A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to whichpeople of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee.  I often wonderjust what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami wouldhave been forced to remain in Cuba.  Would they have revolted and killedhim off, or been killed?    Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in,load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines thatmost people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice ofobedience, prison, or flight.  This would be a bad science-fiction novel,if the East Germans hadn't actually done it.  The last person to diecrossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in theback.  Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled tosocialists in Chile.

It is the "L" word -LOSER !!That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, itis all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mailbuffer can claim they are "too young" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.The eighties were about "How America Learned to Win Once Again". Then(wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, noholds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were afew "little" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, anS&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators tocontend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never hadit so good. In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that onedoesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a "kinder and gentlertype of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots ofdiscourse about people who "don't get it". For those of us in the winningbusiness, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no suggestion of losing.But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our "white male" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another onewith a "Hail Mary" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'threeyards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapsesin the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the weapon of choice these days. Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwoodused to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scottdeclaimed, "Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will not tolerate a loser." And so on. The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - andDemocrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some "equitable" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asianhomosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determinedday when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) minority.Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do mostconservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't carewho's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say somethingabout make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a "neoconservative" or a "neoliberal" depending on how much you want to limitthe pot.Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to bepopular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll stillbe popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, itis the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than anyother place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even inColumbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams inthe eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious preference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of them be white men !!

Which points to an anti-bias-against wrtblacks.In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks arereported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, andsome percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have asituation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of thepopulation commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences,except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!-- There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind ofenvironmental disaster.

According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,  we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as  dramatically.    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group  of Seven nations.    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the  overall U.S. economy.    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.    Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not  reduce demand.    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state  at the expense of the individual.

Reproduced under open license granted by AudioBooks, Inc.-----------------------------------------------------------------This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington,DC  20006.   Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the SouthAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a disputebetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-sweptFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's farmore than that.   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of agiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the SouthAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of thehostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship onall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in theSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade ofthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time acounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period oftime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter iscoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines areoverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannotsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks timewithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the Britishwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon nomatter how risky they may be.   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has nochoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  Thatreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already sufferedlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there willbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained bythe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting eruptswill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battlelosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choicebut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be riskingeven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearingcountless commentators referring to the British task force as an"armada" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be veryuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that itchanged the course of history--and it was none other than theEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during thereign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasionfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drakeand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armadaby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equippedwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out ofreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shatteredthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barelyhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake'sdefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It openedthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start itsexpansion into a truly global empire.   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come fullcircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of theworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and nowthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again inconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing forinvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Fourhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the DrakePassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat ofthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain'snaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada maywell break the back of what remains of the once glorious RoyalNavy.   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLANDTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERETopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this monthit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century anda half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by GreatBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over theFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have beencountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which itcalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothingin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried aboutthem.   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cubais from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewerthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, theremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We arewatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten allabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO'sdoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it'sgot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships haveeven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activatedand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships andsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty andsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force hasgrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armadanumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy hasalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's thisfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in themajor media is "oil."  Vast deposits of oil are known to existunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does itexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentinathis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentineseizure of South Georgia Island.   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands withno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to SouthGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South GeorgiaIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal orhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect itstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while byArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and tookover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,not Britain.   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  Ithas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina orSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks evenmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina'sleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  Theywere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Islandcould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they weresetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Islandwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina'smilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South GeorgiaIsland at all?   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses anenormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installationburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secretinstallation, together with two other similar installations whichI will describe shortly.   The secret military complexes have been in existence for manyyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclearwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here inWashington.  For the past two months I've been reporting thedetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtainand verify them.   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September ofthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threatthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part ofthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  Themutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, theRockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin arebehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 ofthe "PROJECT Z" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phaseis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after bothRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WARONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is theexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places aroundthe world.   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America areworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions ofother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend toride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy inGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally liesmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shatteredremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at thesecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into theopen.  They will confront the world with the only remainingfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and usingthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers ofthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan topave the way for world domination very soon by setting offNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller carteland Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in arace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here arebenefitting from war preparations which were started by theRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years sincethe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the UnitedStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the UnitedStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internalpower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. But before that, the United States had been dominated for decadesboth economically and politically by the Four RockefellerBrothers.   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for worlddomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and halfsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secretwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all thedetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  Bydeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled UnitedStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would beunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, theRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by thelate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early thatthe war being planned would have very different effects on theNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the NorthernHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--GreatBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, thestrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere arerelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expectedthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a NorthernHemisphere war.   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that seriousradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areasnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far thewar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there isvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and SouthernHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air fromthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, thenit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror imageof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,but very little of the air changes places.   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the comingnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere forgenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, theSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  Aquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefellercartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As Idiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, NelsonRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America duringthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called "Coordinator ofHemispheric Defense" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. So that takes care of the South American continent and itsnatural resources.   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefellercontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to theefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTERNo. 36.   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining landmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia andNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to theRockefellers.   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret militaryinstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the comingwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of thesurviving southern half of planet Earth after the NorthernHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere graduallyrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empirewould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the thirdgeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty toinherit the Earth.   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily afterthe war, some means would have to be available to projectmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts againstRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from thebeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwarmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  Aminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one basedin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since thereserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after theNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built inexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be builtand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is nosmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it wasessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard andnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, thesecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclearattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discoveredprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protectionagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while allthese plans were still in the early stages of development, theanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip toSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hiddennaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffswhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port isa gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed offwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the watera huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decidedthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of theSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey ofcandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey coveredcoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areaswere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. Other areas were rejected because they were too close to theequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were toomany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecyimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen forthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.   At last the sites for the secret naval installations wereselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand wasselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extremeimportance in the coming war.   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealandnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites locatedclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of SouthIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comesdown virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of theinstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Islandfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever sinceWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied evencloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The locationis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deepunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are alsotoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the NewZealand site is well situated to command the entire SouthPacific.   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is locatedperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  Thetall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secretinstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that ofNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Islandwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on thenortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away fromthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britaintook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South GeorgiaIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in NewZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's. The techniques were adapted from those used previously to buildother large underground facilities, such as the NORADinstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however thesetechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieveconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed inappearance both during and after construction.   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to letships in and out were kept as small as possible and were wellcamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, theentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  Whensealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless youknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large constructionprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lyingaround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which housethe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock anddebris was disposed of at sea.   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to beoutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fakedisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributedgreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotalrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretaryof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamarapresided over the public paring back of America's visiblemilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantlingof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all thatshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted inNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!   The secret naval installations have been used as duplicationfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed andbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary CasparWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build twoships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship isan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more truein recent years through the use of computerized manufacturingtechniques.   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secretinstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates ofcertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclearpowered--nuclear "subs"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twinwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, andfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have beenfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that weconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all threecarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraftwhose manufacture was financed the same way!   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets areall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, thesecret naval ships possess one key difference.   Last month I revealed that the so-called "Stealth Program" hassucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibilityshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distanceby distorting light waves in its vicinity.   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going intocrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all ofthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already beenoutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealthprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanesbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment thatgenerates the field.   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the AmericanBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left onearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of worlddomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, myfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the UnitedStates Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are incontrol, and they are bent on war.   These secret naval installations have precipitated what isbeing called the "Falklands crisis."Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described"PROJECT Z", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEARWAR ONE.   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners hereare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here inWashington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strikethe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear warwith Russia.   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and incertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortablewar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out instalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the UnitedStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grandstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especiallytheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer andrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know itwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviksthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed twomonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting fornuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time isfast running out.   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can towardwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners inthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom areequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of theBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is thenew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these twomutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts incertain ways.   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that alimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works betweenthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meetingbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turningpoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,and is responsible for the so-called "Falkland crisis" nowdominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this newrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls farshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to besettled between them, but for the time being they have called atruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadlyenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is toslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefellercartel in certain political movements which I discussed lastsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear wartimetable will also give more breathing space for additionalanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-Februarythat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential veryquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effectfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.   The exact details of the "PROJECT Z" war plan are not known toeither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlinesare known to be as I described last month.   It was decided that military action should be devised thatwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, theBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in theSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By workingtogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able todevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled thesebases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way toattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machineprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable bothsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to beattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave theBolshevik war plan still workable.   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assaulton the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There wasno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military forcewhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outsideworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off thevery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a differentmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island wasalso its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protectedthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert militaryassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and herlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel hasdominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operativeswere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the governmentmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the FalklandIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, toenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentinegenerals were not told everything about the situation by anymeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were todo.   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders werepromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after theshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentinehands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert militaryassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster thetroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefellercartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  Withthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attackplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South GeorgiaIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the oldbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it theyalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted asexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship "Endurance" put 22Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore downthe Argentine flag.   The incident provided the desired excuse for the ArgentineJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to aboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed thatSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administeredthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it nowcame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this fromArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.   During late March, Argentine military forces startedassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  "Nothing new",thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried outthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believedthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentineforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, thistime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentinepublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claimsto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the nextday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South GeorgiaIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearanceinitially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point ofview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines wereoverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the jointRockefeller-Russian attack plan.   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentineforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, theteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above thecavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment wasset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russianmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,April 3, the military high command in London finally learned whatwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was underattack by virtually the only means possible.  The jointRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through themountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only amatter of time until their drill would break through the ceilingof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the nextstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put aweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that itwould be a nerve gas.   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of theBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly bedescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like theso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevikcontrolled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, "Me, too"any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything againstRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear warplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respectivecountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discoveredthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a navalarmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order ofthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceedingaround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drillingwould break through into the roof of the naval base in aboutthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach SouthGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  Theforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defendthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval shipswere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle tosail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed withtactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrancedoors would be suicide.   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island wasseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  Hewas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted theRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attackpreparations.   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the othersecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on "RedAlert."  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twinbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already atsea undergoing "sea trials", but that still left seven (7) majorships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of thenuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister,Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He wasalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances fromcertain officials.  He got them!   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with storiesabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet whilenegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly aspossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrivedin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  Theofficial stories about "slow movement" of the British armada wereintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on theannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of SouthGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.   It was initially expected that advance elements of the Britishfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within twoweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the jointRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before itwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made ashambles of the plan.   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingentleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it wasannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran intotrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in ona single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault onSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge andcombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  Inmoments the ship was without any command, its communications andradar silenced.  Then a Russian "sub" closed in and quicklyfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It brokeapart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as isknown, there were no survivors.   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced tworesults, both important:First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlanticby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into aconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that costvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about theprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable forarrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretchingout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the jointcommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word wasflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possibleaction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was gettinginvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy couldbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, theseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases insouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operationalheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeastof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating toprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossibleto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as Iexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, theStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shieldedcommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodesheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the SouthGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip ofSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of theSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the jointRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had beenflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place inNew Zealand!   The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed byother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving outof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in BuenosAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality hewas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the topGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I haverevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines didnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Fourdays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boardedhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, "Time is running out." And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into thehollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik militaryanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completeduntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet wasstill out of range.   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through thelong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it wasdetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, theeffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killedeveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of thebomb are believed to have damaged all the ships insidesufficiently to badly disable them.   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were convergingon the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islandsawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible tothe eye due to their protective shields, which also protectagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for thetactics which the Russians employed.   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven shipsusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by whichPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locationsof the ships to the attack submarines.  The "subs" were armedwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed toexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have beenthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protectiveshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise rightthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven BolshevikStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them wenttheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected fromaround the world.   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset localtime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in publicwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym waswearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taughtalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinningfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russianmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secretBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacificfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  Byworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had wonthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impressionthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the realwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we arewatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  Thataftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have beenpromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressingfor a public announcement that the United States will side withBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heatup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but tofight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot beexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, theBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating andtragic defeat for the Royal Navy.   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are nowconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  Onall sides now we are hearing about the so-called "nuclear freezemovement."  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of allkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recentmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on electionballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors arebanding together to warn the public about what would happen ifthere were a nuclear war.   We are being told that all this is just popping upspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age andnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yetnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans havespontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If youbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, andmoney--and plenty of it.   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relationsmachine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefellercartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If itdoes, they will lose everything because they are not in aposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of theRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there isa war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything inits power to prevent a nuclear war.   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefellercartel creates certain temporary common interests between themand Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this doesnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of theRockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessityright now for the Rockefellers.   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, andthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways withthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world ofthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclearwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day ofreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objectivewith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective isrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their olddream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittinglyprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwarcampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called ReaganAdministration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize onthat latent fear as a tool of power.   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklandscrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefellerpropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument thatsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A newsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill thebill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the neworganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The workingname, though this may be changed, is the "World NonproliferationCouncil."  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth ofnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will beto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY   Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIOLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-calledFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secretBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the SouthernHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of theRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow downthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but theresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the RoyalNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at seamay well be at hand.   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over ourUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  Theydiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If weare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through thepower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripturetells us, our Lord "...has not given us the spirit of fear; butof power, of love, and of a sound mind."  We must learn to wagepeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, "Blessed are thepeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God."   Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.  Thank you,and may God bless each and every one of you.

The unlawfulknowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will. The ModelPenal Code (the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissionersof Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures)defines rape as: A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wifeis guilty of rape if he (a) compels her to submit by force or by threat ofimminent death....

PDT            Q  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)          THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)          Q  The first is that this is the meeting of the Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What are the priorities, because there are several association of Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to participate in setting up priorities for investment?            This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; 42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not very enthusiastic?  Thank you.          Q  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.          THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will be used to support the privatization of existing public enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have some influence over the distribution of.            With regard to your second question, let me say that I would think that there would be people in both countries who would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole history of America, any kind of aid program has always been unpopular.            What I have tried to tell the American people is, is this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on our side and on the Russian side.            So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an investment for the United States.  This is very much in the interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for the taxpayers and workers of my country.            Russia is a very great nation that needs some partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful investment.            Like all investments, there is some risk.  But there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier of the Cold War.          Q  Mr. President, first of all thank you very much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind of a very measured breakthrough.            I have two questions.  One, in your introductory remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions inherited from the Cold War?            PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that would provide not only an important economic opportunity for Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and we agreed to continue to press that.          I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, but that, in order to do what we need to do together to strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join the NPT regime is critical.          What was the second question?            THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the leadership of the Congress.          With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be much less.          With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to begin it in the fairly near future.          Q  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the last part of your speech?          THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know as much as I could about your history.            And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I was following events there very closely and hoping for the day when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a personal feeling about Russia.            I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it occurred.            These are things that have always had a big impact on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)

The reason that people bash WASP's is because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top isgoing to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top.If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we mightall be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies anybetter/worse than the whites did.The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races ofthe world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done(ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to thepresent generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stoppedhundreds, even thousands, of years ago. My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's changethem. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settleanything anyway.>Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be>popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still>be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I >would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it>is the only way to go.That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just becausethey are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school andafter high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't makeyou right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with onlya couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, notto yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only carehow you appear (ie. a Winner).If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way. >Bill R.------------------------------------------------------------------------------"At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

EDT          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out the first pitch.          Q  It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not Amtrack.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.          Q  George, what exactly are you prepared to do to break the logjam with  ??? Senate?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning, and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the important programs that will put people back to work right away this summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be passed.          Q  Will he compromise, that's the question?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President believes his jobs program should go forward.          Q  George, would the President be willing to accept $8 billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise being offered by --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right now, let's see what happens today.          Q  Would he go that far -- no matter what the Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per year?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's see what happens.          Q  It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order to get a vote?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative activity over the last few days.          Q  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package through?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.          Q     prepared to compromise --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting with Senator Dole.           Q  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.          Q  How?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by $500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that he is not succeeding overall.          Q  He can't beat this, can he?          Q  The fact is they can do that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop action.  There's no question about that.          Q  What are you going to do about it?          Q  George, what do you know about these alleged notes taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that when they say yes they mean no?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.          Q   Are you saying that the President said that when the Japanese say yes they mean no?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.          Q  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and there appears to be --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up but I'm not positive.          Q  George, was the specific comment that was made specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general observation on Japanese etiquette?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --          Q  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, "when the Japanese say yes they mean no."          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.          Q  Was he saying it facetiously first?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual observation.          Q  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but I'm not sure exactly how many.          Q  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no      MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is on.          Q  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to hear that.          Q  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.          Q     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, Saddam can't stay in office?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will continue to demand it.          Q  And are you concerned the Iran will become the dominant power in the area --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping support of terrorism.          Q  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you base that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding armaments.          Q  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he would be out of power?     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make it more difficult for him to stay in power.          Q  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical difference with you that's in good faith?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.            Q  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.          Q     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it through?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.          Q     going to rethink the way you attempt to get other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of the summer?          Q     work with Republicans and try to woo some Republicans into your camp?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the President's intiatives?          Q  But on this one -- how are you going to do it differently than you did it on this one because on this one you really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?  Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for particular votes?  When you have to go through --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the President's going to continue to reach out when he can.          Q  You don't have any regrets then about the way you have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this experience?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.          Q  They're being denied any other legislative means of putting their proposals forward.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --          Q     any ideas.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.          Q     to present them.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean they get the votes --          Q     that theirs can be passed though by the parliamentary rules under which they're playing.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.          Q  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?          Q     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about anything recently.          Q     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around the California economic situation, including the situation in Los Angeles.            I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to watch it.          Q  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball management.  Does the President have a position on that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the President intends to continue to go to the ball game.          Q  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see Reverend Jackson while he's out there?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.          Q  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball game?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the President read it.          Q  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be there, and is he going to meet with the President?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.          Q  What is the Mubarak schedule?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice President Gore.          Q  And joint statements tomorrow --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, yes.          Q  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist activities?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.          Q  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in their attempts to get some kind of action.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate action.  But there was no specific information on this specific operation at all.          Q  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in not pursuing some kind of --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.          Q  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing mention in the news conference yesterday --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your question.          Q  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what does the U.S. do next?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an agreement.          Q  George, why do you think sanctions is still an option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When does no mean no and you have to do something different?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.          Q  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something that is under consideration.          Q  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's condition, how he's doing?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.          Q  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning after the Mubarak visit.          Q  Is he going somewhere for Easter?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.          Q  What more can you tell us about the additional aid to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the next several weeks.          Q  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude of the one announced Sunday?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the magnitude.          Q  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where do you stand on that --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a hard look at it.          Q  But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll be able to get our own researchers working as well.          Q  George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a probability than a possibility?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under discussion.          Q  Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter of time and -- for months before that happens.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll continue to review other matters.          Q  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule this week?  Any travel?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right now.          Q  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe,      MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.  We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate discussions.          Thanks.                                 ###

EDT          Q  Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's protest today?          THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest.  I think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago, which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.  And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to the game.  So, I think it's good.          Q  Do you think they're moving fast enough?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.          Q  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break that and get cloture?          THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political pressure not to do it.            And, of course, what it means is that in this time when no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.          THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                 END11:50 A.M. EDT

Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That meansthird trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consultinga 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at 21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks.Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, ora LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you arewrong.By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broadprohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such asCalifornia, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law, but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors,willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter wasterribly upset about this.I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in aclinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wonderinga bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrificedoesn't have a grain of truth to it.-- Clayton E.

PST               Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING on the aid package.     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.       Before taking your questions and running through the basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin tomorrow.          The second point is that this package is designed to support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian government.          Third, the President is determined that we will deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in front of you.          Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.            They also agreed that there would be a new joint commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote a vastly expanded relationship.          If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just give you some general background on what these programs are.  I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.          The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.          The second item is concessional food sales.  As you know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates thereafter for the life of the deal.          The third program is a collection of private sector support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.            The President has also decided to create a privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian government in its priority objective of trying to convert state enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.          The fourth grouping you see there in the summary page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're launching.            The President is also calling for the development of a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in Russia.          The fifth program you see is Russian office of resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say that we have a long-term commitment to this project.            The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much environmental damage.          I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, about the new group being created that the Vice President will chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this problem full-time.            And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a commitment within our own government to have people work on it -- senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly important.          You'll notice that the United States is going to support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.            You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo conference, the G-7 conference.          Before I take any further questions, I'd like to defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance objectives with you.          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.          The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the construction of that storage facility.            And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the last couple of years.            So this is an area where we will be going a lot more work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of START I, an agreement to accede to NPT.           So we are working very hard with all the parties to the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia as a very important step in that process.          Q  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the same one, why do you feel it's necessary?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced today.  So it's completely new.          Q  Can you tell us more about what's involved?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what Russia needs.          So we think this deal is very, very good development for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an American company.  And the American government has played a leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.          Q  So it's to search and also to renovate fields that are already there?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.          Q  On that point, should other American companies expect to get administration support for such deals, or should they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 billion?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, there will be $2 billion in financing available for American companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.          Q  That should take up all of the rest of the deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.          Q  What's the current year budget costs of that $2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any current year budget costs --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.          Q  The concessional food sales -- is there any current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in which the payments are due?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.          Q  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?          Q     and the private sector -- how many folks are going to be involved in that?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt coming into office that there were literally thousands of organization, private organizations in the United States that in one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.          It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of our own government, but the resources of the American private sector and schools and communities across the nation.          Q     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated besides the $300 million the President talked about?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What the President has done this weekend is to consult really intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional measures the United States could take in some of these areas to support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.          Q  Two questions about the $700 billion agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit into that situation?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we could promote American grain sales.            And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked for a concessional loan program.            I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this very important grain relationship, which is important for them, and it's important for the American farm community.          Q  I gather from what you say that this could make it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, is that right?           SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around $640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to respond to a specific request from the Russian government for major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with the Russian government and arrived at this solution.            I think the Russians are pleased because it provides them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on the short-term payments.          Q  Where do those funds actually come from?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want to make that general point again:  Everything in this package, the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be able to do so.          Q  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually have a range from 0 to --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the same level of food imports from the West.          Q  I would imagine there's going to be some considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with some of the other republics?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and roughly 50 percent to the other countries.           In the area of food sales, we have been active with Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are productive and they're hard-hitting.          Q  Has anything happened at the summit to lead American energy companies and other companies to believe that Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of Western governments have the financial resources over the next decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private sector can do that.            We look at our own society and we see tremendous capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production.            That's what the Russian government has told us it wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong signal to the American business community that we support their efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to support them.          Q  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to deliver on making Russia a more --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to the work.          Q  What type of mechanism is already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the Russian government for distribution at their will?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these programs.          But they are all quite different.  For instance, in the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have noticed.          So we literally have here 30 to 40 different activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the Russian government, some with Russian citizens.          Q  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the President has to do on that?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and we'll get back to the Russian government.          Q  You were not prepared for these questions when you got here?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before we take any action.          Q  Is this package designed so that you will not have to go to Congress for anything at this point?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And that's the advantage of this particular initiative.          Q  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are prepared to go to Congress for various things?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where it stands now.          Q  We've been told repeatedly that a number of these items represent different or new ways of spending the money already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways that it was not previously set to be?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've said that these are all projects that either Congress had allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this administration took office and had some new ideas about how the funds might be expended.          We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to further our programs.          And example of that is the Food for Progress concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we found it.          Q  Where, for example, are you getting the money for this Russian officer resettlement --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the Freedom Support Act funds.          Q  In other words, all of the money is being directly spent in new ways, so to speak --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year '92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the legislative history of those funds.          Q     cooperation --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.          Q  Could you tell us please, has anything happened here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's happened here --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very important negotiation that's been going on essentially between Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.            But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.          Q?    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been earmarked and put it into this fund?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.            We could have put in really big numbers and this could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy that the western governments, the combination of governments, put up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is determined, to carry out every single program in this package.  And we'll do it.            But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.          Q     taken it way from any --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.          Q  In terms of funding, there is no available monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, but we thought we should now.            Q  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by initiatives put forward by President Bush?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This administration took office and inherited some obligations that the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments that had been made by the previous administration.            But we have gone well beyond them in funding the enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, is another Clinton initiative.            Further, we listened to the Russian government and listened to the Russian military who told us that the resettlement of their officers was important to them for political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.            I would also say that the President has given impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private sector as well as the American government, to achieve that objective.            So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton assistance package for Russia.          Q  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money will not just disappear because it's being administered by the Russian government?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I know that the President and other senior officials of our government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the State Department will take great care in making sure that the funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their source.          I would not that this package is not simply a package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another example of that.          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one area that we've been looking at very, very closely is consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.          Q  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate in a much more effective way the activities of our own government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw them together and to focus their efforts.          Q  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something up in the next couple of days on that.          Q  This figure is larger than the figure that has been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been together for about two weeks.          Q  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There was so much talk before about the President wanted to get Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  Is that in the out years?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, that support for the creation of private businesses is important to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize the state industries is important to them.            And so what we did was to try to make those the centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been working with the Russian government for months on this trying to work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of these programs was involved every step of the way.            But let me get at the other part of your question.  The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other allied governments that are also active.          Q  There's essentially nothing that happened in the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that you came in with?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've primarily talked about future, about what more the United States and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, which is our base objective here.          Q  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me what about job training for workers who are displaced by privatization?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.          Q     money for job training for workers whose jobs are disappearing because of privatization --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet allocated any money for that.          Q  Why not?          Q     of the $6 million is going to build 450 housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian government.          Q     of the $6 million will go to retrain --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.          Q  Are you talking about apartment buildings or single --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about single, individual dwellings.          Q  You're saying that only 450 families will be served by this?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next couple of months and try to figure out with American organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job done.            I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to spend the money wisely.          Q  What is it about this program that convinces you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, especially considering their other debt problem?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think it's important to note that the United States on its own does not have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do so, which is consistent with our national interests.          Q  Did the President say that the value of the U.S. contribution was that it would create security and prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this program that does this?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, and that is we want to do everything we can to support the continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we have to make a long-term commitment to it.          Q  And then on the question of Russia's ability to repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 years from now?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years from now to pay back those loans.          Q     substantial government-to-government loan we've ever gotten into with the Russians?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of effort.          Q     government loans in any other sector that you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair to say this is a new and unique effort.                               END10:25 A.M. PDT

In fact, they were working so well that unless the fedsdid something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bushand the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replacedGrahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush"consented" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spendingincreases.As it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the capson spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act asPresident (so that he could create his own new plan with more taxincreases).The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office.Chew on that awhile.

Subject: Re: Stop putting down white het males.From: <RIPBC@CUNYVM.BITNET>Organization: City University of New YorkLines: 31From: baba@Tymnet.com (Duane Hentrich)-BTW, I'm a WALC (white aryan lapsed catholic)-----d'baba Duane M. Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com-   I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich callinghimself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs firstin the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal termbut may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotationsare quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion theeightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholarMax Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then theNazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' issynonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people whooriginally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghansand possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the wordby Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, isnontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claimto call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor-shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.  If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``Insearch of the Indo-Europeans" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica.The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literatureas well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans andfor Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horriblethings done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans haveno clear claim.Rohit Parikh

Then they may repeat it over and overagain bu you still have to pretend its funny even though it isn't anymore. Once they are older than six you expect them to realise that doingthe same thing over and over again isn't funny any more.Basicaly Ed fails to be amusing because he is merely crass. He does notmake jokes that have any political content beyond attempting to ridiculetheir target. Calling someone Slick Willie is not funny even if you puton a red nose while you say it, it was a good debating point used on thespur of the moment 12 months ago but now its use merely demonstrates that theuser couldn't think of anything original to say.In the UK there is a tradition of old retired Colnels who bore the dinnerguests rigid with their descriptions of old campagns.

You could easily defineequality to regard the property in terms of it's significancefor the owner. This would a form of equality that would be skewedtoward poorer people.In fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal protection.

Your comparison is a totalfailure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis inreality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assertthat it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible,that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said,you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the onehand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather thana hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twinsmurdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing eachother in the womb when the reality of the situation you describein now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisionsare made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations wherethey cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said,there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claimthat is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has aclaim on a woman's womb.

Whatis different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell thisout for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the onecase you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a bornchild (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetuscan), and in this case you recognize a significant differencebetween the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are atstake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction areirrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inactionanyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and haveborne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have ahealthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat asshe chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks atparties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, andthe provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntarythan the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.Dean Kaflowitz

Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to dowith the discussion at hand? :-)When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimesagainst different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws whichallow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon theconvict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fitinto that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that ofthe standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender,ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask aboutclasses based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personalcharacteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the questionfrom scratch.What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize suchclasses because to do so would be to formally and officially declaresome people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathemato the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.Last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which wouldhave expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-pluscrimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto notprotected by that "aura of deterrence," critics pointed out theabsurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for themurder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of acivilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much morevalueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society.This was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents ofthat viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judgesome lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their"contribution to society."  I view that doctrine as being both (a)personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause ofthe 14th Amendment.Accordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give anyprofession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanismof supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members ofthat class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-rankingmembers of the Executive Branch of the federal government.-- William December Starr <wdstarr@athena.mit.edu>

I have just been informed of what I feel isone of the most important things that we could ever discuss -- The out-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some peopledon't like what he says or thinks.We have all seen the postings here by AJ Teel.  Although many of us havenot agreed with their content, I'm sure most of us have been at leastsomewhat interested in them.  I, for one, am greatful to live (I thought)in a country where people like Mr. Teel are allowed to say what they please.If I don't wan't to read it, I can just skip on by, or unsuscribe.  But,unfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live.  They feelan overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards.  Now it seems thatMr. Teel will be with us no more, due mainly to our brother, and cheifnet police, Ted Frank.PLEASE HELP AJ TEEL REGAIN NET (POST) ACCESS AND CORRECT THIS INJUSTICE.                       ARE YOU ON TED'S HIT LIST?                        ARE YOUR THOUGHTS CORRECT?                          IS YOUR ACCOUNT SAFE?         HAS YOUR SYSADMIN BEEN CONTACTED BY THE THOUGHT POLICE?I thought the NLG and the ACLU supported people with diverse opinions. NOT!

Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) andthf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficultfor them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to mysysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In hisdefense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it hasbeen posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directedat me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at respondingvia netmail...)While I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadminto get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every postI made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were notwhat the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF IAM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have himaxed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. "Argumentumad silence-your-opponent-um"?! I would have thought he would havewanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about andseem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).The issue that seems to be: "Is the following an advertisement?"Apparently, Ted and Mark think so...1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken *off the net* from last year. If reposting an articleconstitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This postdid have a name and address and, yes, a price. If onehad posted the address and subscription price of "Newsweek",would that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of"proof" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complainsto my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo andbehold, "poof", there goes my account. This one had anaddress in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!If you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUEITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you senda note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..." or whatever; theyonly get "I don't like what that user is doing because...".Please do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to themin a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying "Thanks forthe info" or "Could you send me such and such?" or "Your posts arevery interesting... keep it up." and only a handfull of "Go aways". But,I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying toconvince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warranta message complaining about me. (Knock, knock..."My name is Ted andand this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you havesome pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...")NWO Indeed!Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up witha new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.I will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks!Your comments and support are requested. I can no longer postto news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefitfrom making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing sideshut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in theprocess of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying thata lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.Oh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and Iwas just getting started.It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to thecontrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed?We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on peopleon the net that are of "interest" to the government, and Ted sure seemsto have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who doeshe work for? The University of Chicago which he "attends"(?) is wellknown as one of the biggest NWO supporters...And finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account herein the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in theprocess of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybea TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated.

I'm not sure if you meant to imply that or not, but I just thought># I'd bring that up.>Hitler became Chancellor because people voted for his political>party.  That's not a huge difference in a parliamentary system.Your statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In theGerman Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of thelargest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President andgenerally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effectivemajority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose tothe Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is falseas well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either byHitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 electionfor President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff electionin April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.So we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third ofGerman voters.Similarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote inReichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 electionthe Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out ofthe 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and theCommunists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German Nationalparty, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a millionof the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other largeparty was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had butI think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.Thus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointedChancellor.What brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people forHitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties toput their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective governmentfor the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, andtheir parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored theinterests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was anumber of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specificobjectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end thedemocratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the otherparties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were alsoout to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, andgenerally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.Germany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalitionfor five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, andthere certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.If anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failedto get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote hadbegun to decline.Hitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even hissecond choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. Afterthe November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailedon von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his backand support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,who became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to holdtogether a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused toparticipate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some ofthe Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in theparty at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,knowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gainpower lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the countrywas governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even thoughthe Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men toachieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalitionparties to work together.Here's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.True, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. Butthat doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him*before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler totake over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties(Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis.Hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to seethe government paralyzed as a means to taking it over.-----Eric Smitherics@netcom.comerics@infoserv.comCI$: 70262,3610

The federal government or judiciary has the rightto enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law evenif it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them.

The federal government has an interest inthe intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations ofcivil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting alot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically.It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally validsince over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group wasgetting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for beingpart of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the southstick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normallythey wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around wereexpeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to tryit anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection underthe law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intentas much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority tosomebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they didthe school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and thepresident can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of themilitia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at thethousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obeyor face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of MilitaryJustice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god,they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! Andthe governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshallsthat had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we needsuch an ability in federal jurisdiction.-RSW-- * Richard STEVEn Walz   rstevew@deeptht.armory.com   (408) 429-1200  ** 515 Maple Street #1   * Without safe and free abortion women are   ** Santa Cruz, CA 95060    organ-surrogates to unwanted parasites.*   ** Real Men would never accept organ-slavery and will protect Women.  *

EDT               SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.          You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational system.          His philosophy of government, his belief in the importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in the Chamber of Commerce studios.            Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite network and we welcome you here this evening.          Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening also.          I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.          I believe the President has a few words that he might want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that at this time.  It's great to have you.          THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.          I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people from school to the work place.          I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to make things happen.          This satellite town meeting is a good example of that kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all the rest of you.          I have tried as hard as I could to move toward constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.            If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change with changing times.          For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the long run.          We also have to have people who can carry their load.  And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system and continues into the work force where education must go on for a lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can learn.          And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many thousands that have a strong education component so our young people can be learning and working at the same time.          Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good place we can begin, I think, the discussion.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.          Each month we get together and talk about ways that all citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours can prepare students for this world of work.          This week, the Education Department and the Labor Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged areas of the country.            Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your words is that so important?          THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already taught before.          Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is learning because we think that the best and most productive workers will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go into the next year, is really even greater.            Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this educational component of training.          SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or working on something, and they can see the exact and direct application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of young people even beyond the summer.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.            Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it developing.          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people get in a high school diploma.            If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their employers.          So we think America has a big economic interest in trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes two years of further training either in a community college, a vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in a way that would be customized essentially by the business community, based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and the earnings of American workers.          SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the people watching this program -- that the business community and educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The people watching this program probably are the ones who are most directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes already out there.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?          SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.          The business community is going to be actively engaged in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.          Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these players in a community come together and work together and cooperate together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody is talking, but they're not really working together in a common strategy.          And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation skills for on-the-job learning.          And again, those are the critical components.  It's already being done.          THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one point based on my personal experience at home -- the business community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and influence them.  So I think that's very important.          And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.          SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be coming forth before too long.          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.            I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in Congress that will actually define the things that the national government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of life-long learning in this country.          And each one of those goals there's a national role, a state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality that we need to meet.          It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.          Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and I wonder if you would comment on that.          SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had national skill standards to which they could aspire and which employers would understand as a national credential, many of these young people would actually find that they were much more eligible for jobs.          Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce Todd of Austin, Texas.          Q  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are very supportive.            We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much as 3,500 with the federal assistance.            Much of the question that we had designed you have answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's something that we believe is very important to success in this effort.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.          THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.            First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer program and that will move a lot of these young people back into schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're working on that.          Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being trained on a year-round basis.          And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.          Bob, do you want to say anything?          SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And then the state, with all the various school districts, a very important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that moving.          The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.            Doctor?          Q  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an extremely effective learning strategy.          And over the years, we've come to believe that there are several principles that are very important in bridging the school and work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the development of high performance competencies.            My question, then is:  How can the general education faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies can you suggest to achieve this integration?          SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to them and we can discuss it later.          You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?          THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is vocational learning and what is academic learning.          I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think we should have a strong component for people who are in the vocational program.          SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're important for all students.  It's not just a special group of students that needs them.          Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and 12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and career directions.          But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-related work within the classroom, within our schools.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.                                   END9:00 P.M. EDT

To make matters worse, New York also calls its   _second-highest_ court the "Supreme Court, Appellate Division"...Atlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):Oscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company'splant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as towhich came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or hedefendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the courseof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to theplaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from theplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they askedthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al ownedtheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.Atlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)Instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the courtordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, providedthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  Inother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, thepower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoymentof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain isalways problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing aprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But ifit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quackslike eminent domain...)Let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow theplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-milliondollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages."  Blackmail?    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....    "Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under    extortion statutes.")How do you define as "blackmail" one party's act of demanding the rightto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it ownsand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or ofdemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I seeit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position ofowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted tostay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever pricethey wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that saysthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.You go on to say: "The plant would never have been shut down -- theplaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K tohaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount lessthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation."If so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in thebusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements fromother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by thoseother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choicebetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,shouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_business?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that wasAtlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the typeof plant they did where and when they did.)And then you say: "Everyone's property rights were protected; theplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided."As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were "made whole."They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as ownersof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a priceacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ madewhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in thebusiness of ensuring that "unnecessary" settlement costs are avoided?(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts weresupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)> Is _Boomer_ really being taught as "infamous?"  That's really sad if> it is, because I fail to see how it's less than completely sensible.> You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of> filtered through teachers who clearly don't like it, for whatever> inexplicable reasons.(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as "infamous," at least not at myschool.(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring fortheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I firstencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personalopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students getinto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pickand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory ProfessionalResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldlyand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciouslyintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openlybiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructorstend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This isespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, arepracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhatcloistered scholar.  End of aside.)I called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasonsI've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I canonly call "economic correctness" over justice.(2) It is "completely sensible" only if you believe that the allegedright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoidlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, andthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees tonot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people whoown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any otherbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to takeother people's property by eminent domain.)> You'd like Posner, Bill.

So it goes.I've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred toas "law and economics" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economicalanalysis as one of many "tie-breaker" factors which courts may use tohelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured bythe scale of "justice", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economicsof a case as being more important than the justice of a case.-- William December Starr <wdstarr@athena.mit.edu>

For example, Article IV:"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not beviolated"; Article V: "no person shall be held to answer for a capital,or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment bya Grand Jury ...  nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty,or property, without due process of law"; Article VIII: "excessive bailshall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusualpunishments inflicted".Now I've never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens;aren't they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the U.S.?Whether slaves were considered "not human" I don't know, but it seemsthat a case could be made that they weren't treated as "people" as definedin the Bill of Rights. And since the nation is nominally based on theDeclaration of Independence which states that "all Men are created equal,that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness",it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definitionof humanity.-----Eric Smitherics@netcom.comerics@infoserv.comCI$: 70262,3610

Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations toClose Naval, Marine Reserve Centers To: National Desk, Defense Writer Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of          the United States, 202-479-2258   WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve OfficersAssociation of the United States has alerted the Defense BaseRealignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to givesufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.   In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members ofCongress with affected locations in their constituencies, includingSen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine listignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly priorservice personnel.   ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),suggested "concern that the only plausible alternative is that theyare intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reservecomponents from maintaining even today's relatively low level ofparticipation in their parent service's Total Force of the future."   He asked the commission "to remove from consideration alllocations without sufficient and convincing demographic data towarrant approval of the requested action."   "Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserveinstallations on this list are large enough to have a significantimpact on the community, if closed," wrote Hultman.  "The majorissue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a largepercentage of the existing locations."   Hultman reminded the commission, "The fact that the vastmajority of the Reserve installations on this list do not comeclose to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in thisprocess certainly supports the thesis" that these actions aresimply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy andMarine Corps Reserve.   ROA also noted "that at the end of the 1960s, when the number ofNaval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations areapproved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities."   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations rangingfrom South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 NavalReserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., toMissoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps ReserveCenters include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind.,Billings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.

EDT          THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of those who are here.            I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and all of the business and local community leaders from the city and county and state level from around America who are here.           This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to take us into the future.            I entered with the hope that together we could create more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of America's community, knowing that together we could always to more than we could individually and that we might secure our future.          All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're on the right track.          Last July when I was traveling across America's heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business people who were participating in the Louisville Education and Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about -- that for millions of American young people it is really an impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what is learning.          In the world in which we are living, the average young person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased here today.            Whether you're in business or in government or in education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)            They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work for them to do.          All the European countries have higher unemployment rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that I have proposed to create jobs.           In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their people.            But it is especially important for America for two reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to work in this country.  (Applause.)          We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the chance to work.            It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  (Applause.)          So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of the American people to perform without regard to race or income or the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you have got to have opportunity in that mix.           A part of our vision for America has to be a future for every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's something there for them to do?     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private sector.          I said when I addressed the United States Congress in February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the American business community to meet that target so that we can create  more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been created before.          Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people a work experience.  And it is terribly important.          I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to college but do need at least two years of post-high school training either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more people to go on to college who do want to go.          All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.           It also will help a lot of cities and counties to invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities -- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve the environment.            The summer jobs program is an important part of that because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young people into further educational opportunities and to further job opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government has never fully emphasized before.            A lot of these young people, as you well know, because they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next year.            What we are trying to do here is to give people the opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning environment.            There will be more applied academics, more opportunities for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.          The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while they earn, but letting them earn.          You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  (Applause.)          The young people we propose to put to work under our program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, but a challenge that will take them into a different life.          So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved ahead.  I suspect that they will.            This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private investments as well.           We want to honor the companies and the communities, the business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about this event today, I want to implore other private employers to stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)          When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)          That does not mean young people should not be entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)            I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these young people want.          Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just kidding.            On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy country in the world, including the United States, is having difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  (Applause.)          And so the jobs program that I have presented to Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the counties, through the Community Development Program, with the infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.          Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind of system we have and it works pretty well.            But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government should create this summer, so that together we can have this partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a future -- a future that our young people can believe in.            We need to send them a message that here in America if you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  You can build a future from you own dreams.           That has always been the promise of America.  Together that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.          Thank you very much.  (Applause.)                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT

EDT               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm just prepared to take questions today.          Q  George, Bob Dole says that the Clinton administration's policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, President Clinton has said that that suggestion is under active consideration.  Obviously, this is a tragic situation in Bosnia.  And if the Bosnian Serbs don't come to the negotiating table in a constructive way, we'll look seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo.  In the meantime, we're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in the U.N.  We're going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something the President certainly will consider if the Serbs don't come to the table.          Q  How much longer are you going to give them to come to the table, George?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on that right now.          Q  It's been a long time.          Q  On February 19th, the President mentioned the value added tax in Ohio.  And when he was asked about it later by reporters, he said -- quote -- "That is a radical change in the tax system of the United States.  It's something I think we may have to look at in the years ahead."  Questioned again about it later he says, "It is not something that is now under consideration.  If we start considering it, I'll tell you."  It wasn't a trial balloon or anything, he said.  I was just discussing the tax response to a question.  Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote -- "Certainly we're looking at a VAT."  What's gone on?          Q  The same with Alice Rivlin this morning.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The health care task force is reviewing a number of options.  They haven't made any decisions yet.  And as I have said from this podium time and time again, we're not going to comment on decisions that haven't been made.          Q  But you have also said from this podium time and time again --          Q  Wait a minute.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa.            Q     that that was not under consideration.          Q  Yes.  Clinton says, "It is not something that is now under consideration."  Is that no longer true?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe the working group, as Ms. Shalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been made of any kind.          Q  Well, I know.  But he said he'd tell us about it if it was ever under consideration.  I take it that now he is and he didn't tell us about it or --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Did he say if it was under consideration or if it was something to be proposed?          Q  "If we start considering I'll tell you."          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If it's something to be proposed?          Q  "If we start considering it, I'll tell you."  That's a direct quote.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The task force has looked at a number of different options.  They have not made any decisions yet.  The President has not made any decisions yet.  This is -- one of the proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform the health care system.  They have cast a very wide net.  They have looked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of different proposals.  But the President has not made any decisions.          Q  Well, is the President aware of their consideration of this option?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he's been briefed on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task force on this specific proposal of any kind.  I don't know that that's gotten to his level.  He started yesterday to go through with the task force a very wide range of decisions and I don't believe that that's been presented to him, no.          Q  Well, he's not relying on the USA Today to tell him what his task force is considering in the way of taxes.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he's going through it in a very deliberate fashion.  There are a number of decisions that have to be made.  I don't know that this proposal has reached that decision-making point.          Q  If this is still under consideration, that's a change, at least from what we've been told by Dee Dee, I think about three weeks ago or so.  She said, that is not an option, talking about the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I remember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice.  Is that not the case?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if this has been presented to the President as something that is being looked at at some level in the task force.          Q  It was ruled it out, though.  I mean, unlike other options that you've kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled out.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, this is something that is being looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind.  I mean, it doesn't -- it's not necessarily material until you get to the decision-making phase.  The working groups are looking at hundreds of different options.          Q  If it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out now, then something has changed, George.  Yes, no?          Q  When a guy says in February --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the working groups are looking at the widest possible range of options.          Q  So something's changed.  They weren't looking at it before; they're looking at it now.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know if the working groups have gotten to that point yet.  They are casting a very wide net.          Q  How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able to sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now are saying that, in fact, it is being considered?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups are looking at a wide range of options.  They have not --          Q  Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly ruled it out on several occasions in the past month?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't deny that -- I mean, those are the President's words.  Those are very clear.          Q  Subsequent to the President's words, do you deny that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled it out?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about the timing.  I think what we did was refer back to the President's words and say they stand.          Q  So don't they stand any longer?          Q  March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five years it was ruled out.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, those words -- the President did say that in February.  The working groups are on a separate track, and as I said, I don't believe --          Q  Separate from the President?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe this has been presented to the President.          Q  Are they considering something that the President --          Q  Has ruled out?          Q     has ruled out?  I mean, will the President consider a VAT tax?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups have not presented this to the President.  They have looked at a wide range of options.  I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly listen to it.  That does not mean he has decided to do it.          Q  Can we put this another way?  In his answer in Ohio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax system.  Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it might be considered at some future point.  Is that no longer the case, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm not sure exactly what you're asking.          Q  He talked about the VAT in the context of a restructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health care, for example.          Q  Or anything else.          Q  Or anything else.          Q  It was always in the context of substituting for other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.          Q  Has that change, too?          Q  Is that still his view?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I haven't spoken about those specific comments.  I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the working groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT?  Yes, they have.          Q  Certainly we're looking at a VAT, she said.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They have examined the possibility of a VAT.  Has it been presented to the President?  Has he made a decision?  No, he has not.          Q  What kind of a deal do you have when you've got the President's appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line reform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has specifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then goes ahead and announces that that's what they're looking at?  Is the President concerned about that sort of thing?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that the President's concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal possible.  He's concerned with making sure that they have the most thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the different alternatives.  If a decision is made to go forward with something like that it's certainly something the President will explain and justify.  But no decision has been made along those lines.          Q  What does it mean exactly, though, when the President rules something out?  Does it mean it can get back on the table later if a more persuasive argument is made?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just -- that's indisputably true.  If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in.  He has not made a proposal.          Q  What makes him open to it now when he wasn't open to it before?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's certainly willing to listen to the argument.          Q  Was he willing to listen to the argument for a short-term tax this year, and he wasn't willing to listen to it in Chilicothe?  He's now open to it --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The context of his comments was that it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not something he was proposing, not something he was floating.          Q  Not something he was considering.  Those are his words -- "It's not something that's now under consideration.  If we start considering it, I'll tell you."  You're now acknowledging, are you not, that it is under consideration and --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm acknowledging that the task force has studied this proposal.  I am also stating that the President has not made a decision on it.          Q  But the door is open for the President to reconsider including this as part of --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously, the working groups are looking at it.  Again, but the President has not made a decision.          Q  Do you know if they will make a presentation on behalf of the VAT to him?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that.  I assume that if -- I don't know what stage they are it in proposing.  I don't know that they're going to make the conclusion that this is something they should present to him.  I know this is something the working groups are looking at.          Q  Do you understand, George, that none of us are asking these questions in context of a decision that the President has made, only about what the President is considering?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I understand that, and I am acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a VAT.          Q  And the President will consider it?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I assume that he will consider the argument if it is presented to him.          Q  Does that mean the President -- that working groups think that when the President says no, he means maybe?  (Laughter.)          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that means that the working groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible.          Q  George, can I ask you another question about Bosnia?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  (Laughter.)          Q  No, he wants us to stay on this.          Q  Let's do gays in the military.  (Laughter.)          Q  No, he got out of that swamp.          Q  I think we've gotten the bottom line on that VAT.  Reggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked out -- quote -- "We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the arms embargo together with our allies."  That seems to go a bit further than what you've just said --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sounds almost exactly what I just said.          Q  Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept what Reggie --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President has said that this is something that's under consideration.  It is something he will consider if the current actions don't bring the Serbs to the table.          Q  Isn't there some kind of timetable here?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, there is a timetable.  There's going to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days.          Q  That's on sanctions, that's on tightening the sanctions.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's right, that's sanctions.  And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope that that will bring the Serbs to the table.  As you know, Mr. Bartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table.  We will continue to pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option as well.          Q  The question is whether there's a timetable for consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo, not the sanctions.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The next vote in the U.N. is on sanctions.  As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting the arms embargo.  But it is something that we have discussed both internally and with our allies.          Q  Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the U.S. would do that?  What was the point of his telling them that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, clearly, I mean, this is something that's under consideration, and this is something that we take quite seriously if they do not come to the table.  They should know the consequences of failing to come to the table.          Q  Have they been given a deadline?          Q  Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing and it hasn't seemed to change the Serbs' behavior in the least.  Why should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo when so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the fighting in Bosnia?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't accept the premise of your question.  It has had an effect; the embargo is having an effect.            Q  What effect?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If the Serbians choose not to heed our warnings, then they will face the consequences.          Q  What effect has it had in Bosnia?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the effect that it has had on the Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their shipments through.  We can brief more fully --          Q  In Bosnia, George.  In Bosnia what effect has it had?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it's hard to say if it's stopped the aggression to date.  That is why we're continuing to press for the Serbians to stop.  But we believe that over time we will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect.  I'm not saying it's going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn't happened overnight.  But we believe that over time the sanctions can weaken the Serbs.  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come to the negotiating table, we'll move forward with the embargo.          Q  Isn't there a working deadline, George, of the 24th -- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote?  Hasn't the United States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if the Serbs aren't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that we'll seek -- haven't we said that we will seek --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We've said continually we're going to --          Q  But on that deadline?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have a specific date, but we're going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution, by around that time.  And if that fails to take effect, if that fails to bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other actions.          Q  Isn't this awfully incremental?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're taking a step-by-step approach.  We're ratcheting up the pressure and we're going to continue to do that.          Q  Is there a possibility, George, that by the time all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved their goals and then what's the purpose?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the purpose is to get the Serbs to stop the aggression.  We are pursuing that goal on many different fronts.  We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we're pursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through tightening the sanctions.  And we will consider lifting the arms embargo.  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will continue to do that.          Q  But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any campaign be to have the Serbs give back what they've gained?  I mean, once they're entrenched --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't speculate on that.  We're going to continue to press for them to come to the table now.  We're going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression.  But I can't see into the future.          Q  George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans say they're going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to try and explain the details of your package.  They cite polls which show that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.  What's your strategy to counter that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The strategy we have is the one we're going to continue.  As you saw, the President today pointed up the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package will provide:  700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner cities and suburbs to do productive work.  We are also going to point out the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways.  We're going to point up the benefits of immunization.  We're going to point up the benefits of Head Start.  We are going to say that the Republicans have a choice:  they can take action to create jobs or they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years.           Q  Does it concern you, though, that the House now, the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House Republicans voted against it before.  They made a mistake then; they're making a mistake now.          Q  George, does it strike anybody in the administration that it's a bit strong to describe, as the President did this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- "a reaffirmation of a promise of America"?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I think it's the promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full potential.           Q  Government-funded jobs?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To give people a chance to work?  Absolutely.  That is the promise of America.          Q  I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday -- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is on top of.  I did look at it.  There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline.  This will be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million.          Q  The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus package?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  Where does that number come from?  Because we've been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000 new jobs.  And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something like 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, but the summer -- that's when you do their full-time equivalence.  I mean, 700,000 individuals will receive jobs this summer.  When you calculate it for the full-time job effect, you have to do -- I don't know what the exact formula is.          Q  Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- 150,000 or --          Q  One to four because it's three months.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you.          Q  Can I follow up on that?  Did the President misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money for these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the private sector?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not necessarily.  I mean, I think that there will be grants available.  That's one of the ways that you pay for the jobs.  At the same time, he's also issued a challenge to the private sector to hire kids on their own as well.            Q  Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to work at Time-Warner?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the Time-Warner is actually somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant.  That's going to be the bulk of it.  There could be isolated instances, though, where there would be grants to businesses.          Q  Has the President spoken with any Senate Republicans this week?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, but there's been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the White House.          Q  At a lower level.  But the President hasn't?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has not, no.          Q  Getting any closer to get the votes?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're continuing to work on it.           Q  Anybody leaning your way?          Q  On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting something of a breakthrough in Aristide's attitude towards the coup leaders.  Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what impact will it have on the process?  And what did Pezzullo have to say yesterday in his report?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pezzullo did brief the principals.  I can't confirm what's actually happening in the talks.  I would leave that to the negotiators themselves.  But Mr. Caputo has returned to Haiti.  We have received a briefing here at the White House from Ambassador Pezzullo.  And as we have said time and time again, we believe that assurances of security are important to a final resolution to a broader political settlement.          Q  George, yesterday you offered some selective breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities.  Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be impacted?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we have it for most states, yes.  And I think we can get it out.          Q  Could you make that generally available?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe we can.          Q  And could you do it by the component of the stimulus?  In other words --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if we can do -- I know that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs.  I don't know how deeply it can be broken down.  But clearly, we can break it down into summer jobs and other jobs.          Q  And can I follow up?  Is this the information that Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the states?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they're ads, but they're press releases.          Q  Can you describe what those press releases contain?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All we're doing is pointing out the benefits of this package to various states.  For instance, I know that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire.  And I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package creates 1,000 jobs in Vermont.  It creates 2,000 jobs in New Hampshire.  And the people of those states should remind him that this is important.           Q  Where are the releases going?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They go to the states.          Q  To whom?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We can get them.  It's no problem.          Q  Can we get it?          Q  Why don't you put them out here as well?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we can.          Q  This afternoon?  Would that be possible?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to check.  I don't know.  But as soon as we can.          Q  Are you focusing these press releases on states where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're trying to get as many as we can.  It's actually quite difficult to pull this together and we're doing our best.  We're putting them out as we get them.          Q  Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole's schedule?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I was just following it.           Q  Are press releases going along to states where he's visiting?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure.  I think that probably there are press releases going to Vermont.  (Laughter.)          Q  Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting?  (Laughter.)          Q  George, as the President goes about the business of defending what's in his stimulus package, he doesn't address what seems to be the Republicans' main point, that you're funding it with deficit spending rather than "if it's so important, why not come up with the funding for it" seems to be the Republican argument.  And how do you answer that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was answer is, we are paying for it over time.  And if you look at our budget, we pay for this package over time.  We believe right now the economy needs a jump-start for jobs.          Q  You're not claiming, are you, that that doesn't add to the deficit this year?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm saying we're paying for it over time.  I didn't say that.          Q  I know that, George.  But I mean, from the beginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things --deficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This year they clearly will.  But over time our budget fully pays for this program.          Q  What you're saying is that there are savings that would cover this if it were this year in future years?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  That's exactly what I said.          Q  I know that, but there is going to be outstanding debt, it will add to the national debt from this year --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, we're reducing the deficit by $500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years.          Q  You mean you're reducing it below what it would have been?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Exactly.          Q  In fact, you're adding a very large amount to the national debt over the period of --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But we're reducing it far more from what it would have been.  That's true.            Q  Washington-type reduction.  (Laughter.)          Q  You're getting to be a grumpy old man.          Q  George, has any decision been made about the White House or the President's participation in the gay rights march coming up in a week and a half?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on the President's schedule now.  I believe he's going to be at the Senate Democratic retreat in Jamestown that weekend.          Q  Will he address it by phone?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about that.  It's a little far out, but I believe he's going to be in the Senate retreat.          Q  So will he have the leaders in a day or two before the speech?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I would expect that at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups.  I don't know the schedule on it, though.          Q  Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in conjunction with the event?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.          Q  April 22nd is Earth Day.  What is the President going to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign the biodiversity treaty that day?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know there's been some work on the biodiversity treaty.  I don't know about signing it that day, but I would expect he'll have a statement on Earth Day or right around then.          Q  Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to check with Katie McGinty.  I just know that there's been some work done, but I don't know exactly what.          Q  When is Earth Day?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The 22nd, I think.          Q  Why is it you know that he is going to have a statement on Earth Day but you don't know if he's going to have a statement on the gay rights march?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I said I don't know if he's going to meet or when he's going to meet.          Q  Do you have a statement on the gay rights march?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't, actually, no.  I wouldn't be surprised if he did, though.          Q  Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a working visit on Friday and the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and the trade issues between the two countries.          Q  There was some expectations that a second aid package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if I understand, it hasn't happened.  Why is that or what's the status on that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The G-7 meeting is still going on and, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked about the outlines of a possible package.  But we're going to continue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that.          Q?    We will not then make any kind of announcement during the two-day meeting?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The meeting's not over yet.            Q  Is that when you're going to make one?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not ruling out the possibility.          Q     the President's going to announce it tomorrow.          Q  Bentsen said that.          Q  Yes, Bentsen said it would be tomorrow.          Q  So did Christopher.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to look at that, but I believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of Tokyo.          Q  George, has there been further consideration here about going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that there's -- it's not something we've ruled out.  We don't have a date set for it.          Q  George, you all have a position or do you support Immigration's plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United States?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the first I've heard of it.          Q  George, there was a report today about the --          Q  Fortunately.  (Laughter.)           Q     about the pace of appointments and says that President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions that people have been nominated for.  Are you going to speed up the pace of nominations or where do you stand with it?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We filled 814 of the President's appointments.  And it's broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147 noncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time.  I'm not sure what that means --(laughter) -- 70 PA full-time.  And this is about the same -- it's about the same pace of President Bush.  Obviously, as you move along farther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments.  So we expect the process to speed up.  But we're at the pace of Bush.  Obviously we'd like to get these done as quickly as possible.            I would point out that the FBI background checks and the background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time than our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup.  But we're working on it.          Q  Is that because of Nannygate?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's an awful big part of it, yes.          Q  In the story this morning, you were at approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way behind in winning confirmations.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's where the background checks comes into play.  That's the problem.          Q  That's the background checks problem?  Because I mean, you have a Democratic Senate --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, that's not the -- you make the appointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all the forms and have the background checks done.  That's exactly where the problem is.          Q  What's the President doing this afternoon, and what's on the plan for tomorrow?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got some meetings -- just office meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of issues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues.  And then he'll be -- tomorrow we'll have an event, probably again focused on the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House.  And Friday is the Miyazawa meeting.          Q  Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow, George?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Either tomorrow or Friday.          Q  Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the Japanese Prime Minister's visit tomorrow?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about tomorrow, but we'll probably get something done, as we usually do, for these visits.          Q  Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you know what that was about?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was here.  He met with a group of us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty.          Q  Who?          Q  Reverend Jackson.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Reverend Jackson.  Mack McLarty, me, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan.           Q  Talking about Haiti?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We talked about general urban policy.  He is about to go to Los Angeles.  He was just back from Mississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he's going on to Los Angeles.          Q  Did he request the meeting?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Actually, no.  He's in continual contact with the President.  He had written a letter on a variety of issues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it.          Q  George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords tonight in Vermont.  Have you guys been  in contact with Jeffords at all on this?     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's been some contact, sure.          Q  Can you tell us about the contacts?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure --           Q  Do you know who contacted him or what was said?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that Howard Paster talked to him and they just has a general talk about the package.          Q  And did he express his support for it now, or is he --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't divulge the details of the conversation, but there have been conversations.          Q  The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion --elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care package.  Is this something the President is considering?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again --          Q  Along with the VAT?  (Laughter.)          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's certainly something that's been looked at, but no decisions have been made.          Q  What was the question?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The L.A. Times story on whether abortions will be covered by the President's health plan.          Q  Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of the verdict in L.A.?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we certainly talked about the situation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic development and other issues.          Q  For instance, did you discuss whether it would be helpful for the President to go there or not?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we discussed a wide range of issues related to Los Angeles.  That was certainly one of them.          Q  Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in, I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, good.          Q     your reaction to Margaret Thatcher's comments that you're just sitting by and watching a massacre.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we've been pushing very hard on a number of fronts for more aggressive action.  We will continue to do that.          Q  Can you tell us if you've made any progress in your talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise?  I mean, we don't have any feel except talks are ongoing.  Have you talked to like 20 people or --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the numbers.  We've talked to several people and we've had wide-ranging sessions.            Q  Anyone leaning your way?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't get into that.  We're just going to keep working through Tuesday.          THE PRESS:  Thank you.

As usual, Sahl's was independent and sharp as a scalpel.My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for delivery.Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt.The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) was "betrayed to France by a representative of his government" when there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that "in a school or during a commencement ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional." Of course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop $22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these days.)Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a RICO indictment.On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For example:On Their Own Qualifications to Control SocietyHitler: "Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises" (page 577).Limbaugh: "Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase "with half my brain tied behind my back to make it even"] denotes the egress of mental aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking and screaming all the way." (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)On Religion as the Basis of a NationHitler: "In this world human culture and civilization are inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the expulsion from Paradise." (Page 581.)Limbaugh: "America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of American education has declined ever since?" (pages 274-5.)On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social CollapseHitler: "The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the service of a moral idea of State and culture." (pages 346 and 348.)Limbaugh: "Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality and monagamy. They disparage American heroes." (page 254.)On the News MeidaHitler: "The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews." (Page 331.)Limbaugh: "Elements of The Media have jumped on the bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania." (pages 270 and 268.)*     *     *To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for The Fascist States of America.And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-0845; (608) 255-4460.--- 30 ---

Beginning with U.N. Security Council Resolution 713 of   September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively   addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security   Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all   unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There   have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages   in Bosnia have been bombed.    In response to these violations, the Security Council decided,   in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all   unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize   Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.    NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air   enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General   was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY   FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating   allies.    The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my   direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to   all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct   of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by   the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces   initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and   12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.    These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m.   e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for   combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.    NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air   patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early   Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally   operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the   Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching   the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted,   escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these   steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such   aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by   NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved                                   more                                      (OVER)                                  2    rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will   be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations   Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was   consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully   considered before the rules of engagement were approved.    It is not possible to predict at this time how long such   operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces   to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional   authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and   I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward   toward attainment of our goals in this region.                      Sincerely,                            WILLIAM J. CLINTON                                       #  #  #

HEY MAN, ACADAMIA RULES!!Barf.You mean the same economic theorists who say things like "for the sakeof convenience in mathematical modeling we will first assume there isno wealth creation" now get a crack at implementing their PhD thesis inreal life?Go back to your textbooks on macroeconomic theory. Look in the first chapterof that book, introducing the field of macroeconomic theory. Right therein chapter 1, section 1, is a statement like the following:"As it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation,especially in an economy where wealth creation is inherentlythe province of individuals who create new inventions anddiscover new ideas, we will assume for the rest of thisbook that there is no wealth creation."We do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world,however the mathematical modeling of such an inherentlyunpredictable subject is impossible. Even though we assumeno wealth creation, we do believe that for most mathematicaleconomic modeling such an assumption is reasonably validas it allows us to make predictions which then can be tested."So the guys who are running the store for Clinton and company are nowassuming that wealth creation does not exists. They are (borrowing anidea from the Hitchhiker's Guide) too advanced to think of these simplethings.To be honist, I would rather have an engineer with years of experiencebuilding bridges design the next bridge, rather than a theoreticalphysicists with a freshly minted PhD and no experience do the same job.- Bill WoodyNormally I don't post (or even read most of the postings) in this newsgroup.If you would like to reply to this message and want me to see the reply,then I guess you will just have to reply directly to me.

Thus itis tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directedfollowups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the politicallessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.In article <1993Apr14.121823.21851@oneb.almanac.bc.ca>, kmcvay@oneb.almanac.bc.ca (Ken Mcvay) writes:|>As Dawidowicz points out, in "The Holocaust and the Historians," (Harvard |>University Press, 34-38):|>|>"...the nadir in Hitlerology is reached by David Irving's "Hitler's|>War."<34> An amateur historian, whose reputation as a German apologist and|>as a writer without regard for accuracy or truth won him a measure of|>notoriety, <35> Irving produced a 926-page work intended to show that Hitler|>was kind to his animals and to his secretaries, that he was "probably the|>weakest _leader_ Germany has known in this century," and that he did not|>murder the Jews or even wish to do so, but that the murder was committed|>behind his back, without his knowledge or consent." Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Doesthis mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murderbecause he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardentsupporter?One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the systemwas far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI partyitself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there wasnoone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did notoriginaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within ituntil his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler renegedupon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced theold guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implicationsof their rhetoric. This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies mustbe considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one "race"of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal ofhumanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,the gas chambers of Auschwitz.The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man wholead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was theevil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an egocult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not howevermean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he andhis propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism canproduce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be emphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction betweena govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only thelatter as a "strong" government since most displays of strength are madenecessary by an essential weakness.It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were theyamoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in thesame manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the causeof morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in theirlogic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such partiessuch as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assertthe truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocatesof a system that would commit genocide. The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil isinescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not letthe conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas thatwere basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils ofthe concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticalydoes not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.No matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally madethe pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also createsa dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For manyin government politics is a method of providing a justification fortheir own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since thecontinued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of theessential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoliwhich has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is importantto realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the rightand those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcementof popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism throughtheir assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamicsof political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. Theleaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only doso voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression ofones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermorein taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the wholebefore personal concerns, even of personal security.Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatredand an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commitgenocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member ofthe system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibilityof changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot affect the system.Phill Hallam-BakerPhill Hallam-Baker

This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada'sviolent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S.  (Ournon-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate).  Itwould seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of guncontrol laws.       I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural andenforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and thenthat reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.>Given that most>criminally used guns are either legally purchased or stolen from those who>purchase them legally, having more restrictions on legal possession does >seem to have the effect of reducing gun-related crimes.

(Well, it makes sense to some of us, anyway.  ;-)       The other side of the coin, of course, is that far "illegal drugs"are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally. I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminalshave shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources(stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simplysee South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns aswell, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.>>If you would just look a little closer at the crime statistics, you would>>realize that:>>  -our non-gun crime rate is also very high, so guns per se are not the issue>>Directly contradicted by the NEJM study that compared crime in Seattle and>Vancouver, B.C.  The non-gun rates were roughly the same for both cities.  The>difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gun-related.          And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiquesof it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel cometo mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almostentirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketedfor poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when youcompared the white majority they were virutally identical.        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relativeconditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage ofnomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take intoaccount that the non-whites in either city were not living in thesame conditions.        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which arearguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a farhigher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not onlynot significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightlylower.>>  -violent crime is highly concentrated in the inner city>>Surprise.  Pick the area with the highest incidence of poverty, drug use, disease,>etc.  Since rates are lower in suburbia, us middle class folks can ignore the>problem.       The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. "inner-city"problems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a conditionwhich is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violentcrime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun controlis the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As oneCanadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun controlin 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increasein violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparentlythey didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime inthe early eighties.>>  -most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already>>Post hoc ergo propter hoc.  Those areas implemented gun control because of>the high rates.         True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., wheregun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but thatcrime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was highor low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impactviolent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than itwas going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate bysaying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be institutedto deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, youcan't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause ofthat gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun controlwas implemented, just as happened in Canada.>Similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control.       As would be expected if violent crime was generally independentof gun control.>And the jury is still out on the question of whether recent tough laws in >Washington D.C. may have alleviated violence and suicide rates there.

Less people to persuade, and less "contributions" to make.        Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate atthe Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the littlestate battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,medicine, and most other questions.      Local government has not "failed" in that it hasn't done what itshould, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-localinterests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get theirrules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout,only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level becauseit can impose its will on the lower.      I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congresof the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposedto a local crime?

And since industries can't concentrate their political powerand wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and getwhat they want, individual voices have more relative impact.

The trap is the easy way out.For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that thedemographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You'regoing to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnicgroup or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factorsleading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually thannot, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very fewBlacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crimestatistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you thenworry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireableor whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction todefine "us" and "other" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerouswhen we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rationalhumans.It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racialmakeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live inSan Francisco, a city that loves to tout its "ethnic diversity". Here, wehave Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the "model minority") gangs,and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularlytroublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to theirpropensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people onthe street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs andcrime are what they most fear. During the "disturbance" in Los Angeles lastyear many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! Iremember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobswhere there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleanedfrom TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relativesthat live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first trulymulti-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion thatin the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*riot!In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting pointsthat really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring theracism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. Asa people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problembecomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I trulybelieve that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our currentcourse of denial and repression.I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,luck in avoiding the "trap".

The government provides free health care to all U.S. >residents. And there are no out-of-pocket costs. Wrong.  In better EC countries that use pure (but public) healthinsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-likesocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementaryinsurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 editionhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital andbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  Thepublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amountfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket oraccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds ofFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of healthcosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from othertaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expendituresfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figurefor the U.S.That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fundis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such backin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real healthinsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoffof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian"faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but thatjust a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the averageCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their Americancounterparts on issues like these).I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget aboutleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadiannewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100%insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't knowit, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (Americanconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones whoseriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about theAmericans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germanswho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things thatshouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals forinsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason thatthe Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despitebeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge tospend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're adifferent culture.>Like the play or pay model, managed competition leaves in place two >elements of the current health care system that reformers most often >criticize: the private, for-profit insurance industry; and the >employer-based system of coverage.

"Managed Care" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most westernnations that use only public health insurance like Canada, Franceand Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be saysof HMO/NHS approaches, "We left that behind with East Germany!").Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers stranglingdoctors with budget strings.In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in Franceand Germany, with all private doctors and both private and publichospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisionsare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked"sickness funds" over a century old while Canada divides by theirprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with thedoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 tothe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. TheFrench and Germans use the same approach but have larger populationsin more compact geography to improve scales of economy.gld--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Gary L.

For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover whycertain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can'tmake a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurancerates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medicalmonopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so theymust move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunkingof waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in theU.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. DennisE. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada'shealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is onesmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.>WOULDN'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW  >FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS?  >>In Canada, provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  >care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, ambulance service, and private  >hospital rooms, -- so many Canadians do end up buying some private  >insurance. A policy to cover all of these things runs about #40 to $40  >a month.  Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germanycase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the publicsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extrainsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. wardaccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personalbenefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to becovered for basic care.At that point, they wouldn't even consider a "voucher" approachto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make upthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.>******************************************************************  >>WOULDN'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY  >ACHE AND PAIN?  >>People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about  >a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  >bills.  >>Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor's -- have a lower  >per-person health bill than we do.It is "free" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (twothings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more likereal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that whenworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was payingfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on mypay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but onlyannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscalnaifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left forthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurancecoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a privatehospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospitalrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the samecash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paidout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, notgleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public andprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods thatyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.>ISN'T THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG  >AND POWERFUL TO KILL?  >>Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be  >"politically thorny," in the quiet words of one advocate for a  >national plan.

You can opt out in Canadaand Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result becausethere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without therisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxeamenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set onthe fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to patthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebeclast spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned againstany thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province'spublic health insurance plan.gld--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Gary L.

EDT               Q  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike Whitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh International Airport and with me is the President of the United States Bill Clinton.          And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.          THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.          Q  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just breaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard that two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and Officer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been found not guilty.          It's a situation that's been building for over a year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your administration and what you're trying to do.          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the American people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the efforts of the federal government in developing the case.          The law under which the officers were tried is a complex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did most of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked Rodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some blows, and another officer who was a rookie.          No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but it appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They acknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think that the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country together and not violate the civil rights of any American; secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.            I think it's important to recognize that in the poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're even more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police officers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to violence and drugs.          And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed areas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles who wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many problems as we do.            And I laid out a very ambitious program in the campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment to bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the country.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to the new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several other people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.          Q  Let's talk about what brings you to the Pittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  You've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break that gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to Allegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that battle?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it gives the country a very different budget for the next five years than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.          But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the Senate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a bloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come to a vote.          I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote for the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to stay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases the deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending targets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for this year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five years.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the economy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that are holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.          So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work right now to show that we're changing the direction of the country.  And that's the purpose of the bill.          Q  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or his office lately?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison operation to the senators that we think are open to this --Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life of the budget I presented.          You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life of the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we have this program well below the spending targets that Congress has already approved for this year.  And they've done this for years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as putting the American people back to work.            So I just hope that this doesn't become a political issue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and the need for jobs.          Q  I have some questions from people who supported you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  It has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the White House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go through.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull it off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew it was going to be like this.          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving very fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in history, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we are moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole wide range of things.            But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn it around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions which led to the victory I received from the people in November, and we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making real, real progress.            I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  We're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going to happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing things.          Q  Thank you very much.            The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, here live at Pittsburgh International Airport.  I'm Mike Whitely, KDKA News.                               END10:31 A.M. EDT

EDT                                       THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming toyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radiostation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city tomeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,health care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weeklybroadcast with the American people.                           I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 whenit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the pastseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch withthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bustour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in lastyear's campaign.                          Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk withyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds andwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reportingto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.                          You sent me to Washington to get our government andeconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a badexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how importantit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we dobusiness.                            We live in a competitive global economy.  Nationsrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitivenessof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and thecooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,labor and government.  Although many of the economies of theindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they'vemade many of the smart investments and the tough choices whichour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of themhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have beenfalling behind.                          We have an economy today that even when it grows isnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nationby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much toshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people havestopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeksand that too many families can no longer afford the escalatingcost of health care.                          But we also know that, given the right tools, theright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers andbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economyneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities betterplaces to live.                          In many critical products today Americans are thelow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure thatwe create more of those kinds of jobs.                          Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan forlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the oldpriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs tobe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobsand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping thewaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our preciousresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays thegroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.                          These new directions passed the Congress in recordtime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in ourcountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which wouldcreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the privatesector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  Itnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. But it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in theSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they knowwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.                          The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation andcounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs billhas been grounded by gridlock.                            I know the American people are tired of business asusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spinor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I havetaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extramile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.                            It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 millionAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the billlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will meanhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is toact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By takingthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, Ithink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significantportion of our original goals.                          First, we want to keep the programs as much aspossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,including highway and road construction, summer jobs for youngpeople, immunization for children, construction of waste watersites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep fundingfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people whohave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn'tcreating jobs.                          Second, I've recommended that all the other programsin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40percent.                          And third, I've recommended a new element in thisprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight againstcrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehirepolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and putthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fightfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need itand deserve it.                          Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --the Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because itincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending thisyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,doesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is morethan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and thisbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by theCongress this year.                          It's amazing to me that many of these same senatorswho are filibustering the bill voted during the previousadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind ofemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put theAmerican people to work.                            This is not about deficit spending.  We have offereda plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your prioritiesare -- on people or on politics.                            Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollarfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's thesoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and ourchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobsand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all ofus when we've helped make more American partners working toensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.                          You know, if every American who wanted a job hadone, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in thiscountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest firststep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this countryagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.

Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.       In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billiondollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase ofapprox. 884 billion dollars.       In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars.That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccountedfor.  (This represented an increase of 230%)       In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs,Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare)cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, ormore than national defense started.  (This represented an increaseof 230%)       In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars onMedicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of368%)       In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housingcredits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.       In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billiondollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.       Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.       Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.       Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.       Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.       Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.       Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.            About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under the Energy category, primarily under "Supply," and "Community Development,"in the area of "disaster relief," and between the two of themrepresent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.

From your post, you apparently find the idea thatsomething is wrong with African Americans, value-wise, culture wise orsomething, very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non africanamericans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assertthat something is wrong with us. The socio-economic factors which we know help to produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large proportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, wesomehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has socioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a dysfunction.Basically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe thatsomething is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want todeal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against africanamericans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible bethat the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this hasa very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us.Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they are so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage. I would get angry if it werent' so damn typical.Peace - Aaron

I don't know about the rest of the country, but *our* educationproblems stem directly from two problems, neither of which are a lackof money in the state.  (BTW, Tennessee is considered a "tax heaven"and our economy is one of the strongest in the country.  *I* seea correlation.)  1)  What money we spend goes primarly to administration.The average administrator makes two and a half times what the averageteacher makes, and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue.  And 2)the Governor is making a concerted effort to create an "Education crisis"in order to push for his pet income tax.  Some of the most idioticprograms get funded (like State funds for new art in the county seat)while schools are closing.  It's not a lack of funds.

He didn't say so, but Iknew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the truth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no obligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if whatyou say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling such basic services, too).> >>******************************************************************  >>>>WOULDN'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY  >>ACHE AND PAIN?  >>>>People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about  >>a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  >>bills.  >>>>Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor's -- have a lower  >>per-person health bill than we do.> >It is "free" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two>things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like>real health insurance -- which actually it is).

But it's another possibility). They'd have an added bonus when arguing against government involvement in their industry-as they could then point to its failure instead of just citing theoretical principles.

One approach is simply to try and move political opinionand hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Anotherapproach is to try and amend the constitution.  The originalconstitution restrained the U.S. government from economic interventionfor 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it.The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrainsgovernment (particularly state and local), even though on manyparticular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I thinklibertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint viaan amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this asa problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That mightbe true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  Ifa libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and thenfalls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This isunlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that heldfor a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now,but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of,if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.-- Ervan Darnell                                        ervan@cs.rice.edu

(They do account for a somewhat largerportion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.)Some facts.  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% oftotal health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averagedpaying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.  Malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985;they've declined significantly since then.  At the same time, healthcare costs have increased more than any period in history.As far as "defensive medicine" is concerned, the AMA estimates that itstotal impact is about $7 billion per year.  That's about 8% of the totalcurrent INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a groupthat could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicineon health care.As small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however,Clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnificationof MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by theirspecialties.  This would eliminate most, if not all frivolous suitswhile retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice.jsh--Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   "One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From manyof the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports I have seen, this adjective      is commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain aboutthe use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say thatMr. King was a no good black!  I do not know Mr. King and would not make thisascertian without some evidence to this effect.

I don't feel compelled todiscuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there wouldnot have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating wouldnot have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult callto make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.        I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive thanme using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner.  Would you havebeen happier if I had used 'African-american' ?

As for death threats, I happen to know from personalexperience that gay people are far more likely to receivethem based on political veiws or even personal philosophiesrelated to the issue of sexual orientation than are heterosexuals. Not a week goes by that I personally or one of my friendsis not physically or verbally harrassed for even appearing tobe gay.       Everyone is garaunteed certain unalienable rights underour current form of government in theory, yet every day gay people are victimized by their local governments, bythe police force, and by (for the most part) an uninformedand ignorant public. Is this democracy? I don't think so.   A society's sense of justice is judged on the basis ofthe treatment of the people who make up that society.All of those people. And yes, that includes gays, lesbians,and bisexuals whose "crimes" have no victims, and whoare as varied and diverse as the society of wich they area part.-- Frank Jordan                                                [D[D[D[C[C[C              Gay Arab Bassoonists UNITE!!!

Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortablewith the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion canbe virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it iseliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.  For example, does "non-initiated force" (coercion) include tax collection?Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisionedby Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than thestate, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after thefact arbitration/legal compulsion?  >>The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic>which I'll address briefly.

I'd venture to point out, however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group of "seminar participants" to "embrace" their philosophy, their propaganda skills need to be honed.  Frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a propergovernment policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalitiescan be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said,the state will just wither away.  On the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the current society will help us to live happier lives? Or is it likesocialism; just some short-term pain that we'll have to bear until everyone has had the benefit of "re-education" through regular "seminar" training?jsh>>Roger Collins--Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   "One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

After the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of coursethe classical systems. Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were models though because the political systems of both countries were acknowlegeddisasters. The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federalstate was constructed a war would be inevitable. The Greek democracies werealways fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade. Hadthe federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape ofBritain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in duecourse.

[the phrase "with half my >brain tied behind my back to make it even"] denotes the egress of mental >aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree >with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media >will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking >and screaming all the way." (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show, BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves ratherthan blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions.He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to beintelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much).This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience istreated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was justkidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems andneeded to be exterminated.>On Religion as the Basis of a Nation>        Hitler: "In this world human culture and civilization are >inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his >decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without >culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord >sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the >expulsion from Paradise." (Page 581.)This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  SinceChrist was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization ofthe Aryan as "the highest image of the Lord" fits with Christian doctrine.>        Limbaugh: "America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... >But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or >ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a >charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools >for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of >American education has declined ever since?" (pages 274-5.)Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success thanpublicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo-Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalentto Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reachingjust a wee bit here.>On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse>        Hitler: "The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... >One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and >theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... >Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays >must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the >service of a moral idea of State and culture." (pages 346 and 348.)Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainmentindustry here.>        Limbaugh: "Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that >Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people >who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality >and monagamy. They disparage American heroes." (page 254.)Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocategovernment control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio showto confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and thedepraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control of Hollywood.90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at anearly age the "right" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr. Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the "young heads fullof mush" hyperbole indicates.>On the News Meida>        Hitler: "The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of >gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass >by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the >people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of >slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews." (Page 331.)Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea forgovernment power to be used to break up the conspiracy.>        Limbaugh: "Elements of The Media have jumped on the >bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been >replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During >the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global >network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't >realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that >therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided >and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania." (pages 270 and 268.)Indication here that "Elements of the Media" (since career is a self-selectedcategorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented inthe populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable.No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, onlythat for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in thesituation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he wouldoppose government control of the media.>*     *     *        >To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but >ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance.Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting peoplewho disagree with them.

Mr. Clinton is increasing fascismin America through "business/government partnership" and increased levelsof taxation.

One can only >wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.Hmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitlerbecause he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out ofracism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned toracism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal Left.The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hookedon the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, SocializedEducation, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clearto me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.>The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701->0845; (608) 255-4460.>>--- 30 ---This is the same address as "Idiots Anonymous", isn't it?Matt Freivald--------------------------------------------------------------------------LiBORGalism:             THINKING IS IRRELEVANT.

One might findoneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near termthat require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting afew weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December withpreferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations ofwhat would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respectsbeside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given tounsophisticated investors in late 1986 to "sell now and save ontaxes."  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similaradvice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advicewas based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986),but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates(without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimaleconomic interest.

EDT            Q  Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?             MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to 10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At 11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At 12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations.Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the various groups.          Q  A photo op with Vessey?          MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.          Q  Why?          MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.            Q  What about the lunch?          MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.          Q  Is he meeting with any congress people today?          MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.          Q  There are no meetings --          MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today, no.          Q  Has the President been given any information by the Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the Vietnamese on that subject?          MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese about first.          Q  Did the President talk with any Republican senators yesterday about the stimulus package?          MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.          Q  How many times?          MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last night.          Q  What was the outcome of that?          MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind of an agreement on a jobs package.          Q  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any way flexible on this?          MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some kind of an agreement.          Q  Did they discuss the VAT tax?          MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.          Q  Can you check that?          MS. MYERS:  Sure.     Q  So what are they -- is the President offering to scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down to where Dole will sign on?          MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress including, obviously, Senator Dole.          Q  Is he talking to anybody else?          MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other Republicans yesterday.          Q  Is he talking to anybody today?          MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it out.          Q  We were led to believe that the President called Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?          MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business, but it was both.          Q  In the President's mind, are they linked politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to the American people?  Has he made that argument?          MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional Russian aid last night in Tokyo.          Q  But does the President believe that the stimulus package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?          MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs package through the Congress.          Q  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating now with Dole?          MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.          Q  On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?          MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the Senate for the jobs package.          Q  But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other than Shelby?          MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a vote.          Q  What about Kohl?          Q  Kohl and Feingold?          MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of the members of the United States Senate support the package.          Q  If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold, why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?          MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.          Q  No Democrats.  (Laughter.)          MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.          Q  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any other Republicans again today?          MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but again, I wouldn't rule it out.          Q  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to any other states today?          MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest how their states would benefit from this package.          Q  Will you share those with us?          MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.          Q  Do you have copies of the ones you sent --          MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And we certainly can continue to provide them today.          Q  Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has been given?          MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add to that.          Q  But he also said that business and labor groups are telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --          MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't think he said he was directly contacted by them.          Q  Are we to take that to mean that the administration has sounded out business and labor groups on this --          MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think I want to add to that.          Q  In February, though, the President said that this was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What has happened between then and now to cause this administration to change its mind?          MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is something that the working groups are looking at.  They're considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to specific options that will be covered by the President's health care plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.          Q  You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being considered by anyone in the White House after the President's comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.          Q  And then suddenly --          Q  What happened?     MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added tax.     Q  But the President himself took this off the table, Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?     MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and no decisions have been made.     Q  And it raises the question of how independently the task force is working.     MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're considering all options.     Q  But that's not the impression that the President left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was not on the table, not an option.      Q  "If it changes I'll tell you."          Q  Bring him on.     Q  And you repeatedly referred to the President's remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.          MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)          Q  But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers --     MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.     Q  Is it because he has very few options?     Q  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with the President?       MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a decision on.     Q  They will present it to him as one of his options, though he specifically ruled it out?     MS. MYERS:  Correct.     Q  Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to this form of taxation?     MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that they're looking at is the VAT.      Q  Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period that you were telling us that it was not?     MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of their drafting of options is.  I don't know.     Q  Who was telling you that it was not under consideration?     MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's comments.     Q  Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise enough money to fund the core benefit package?     MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made on how to pay for the health care plan.          Q  I'm asking whether the projections --          MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out until you know.     Q  Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer models on a number of possible packages.     MS. MYERS:  Correct.       Q  The question is whether they have now determined whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.     MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.            Q  And when the President has been meeting with health care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing --          MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q     they have never once said to him, these are your funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT in his --          MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular briefings.          Q  Well, you have.          MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.          Q  No, but you said that it has not been presented to him as an option.          MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q  That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.          MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.          Q     specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?  Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --          MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly, it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean, that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.  It's something that the working groups will present to him among the number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where health care issues are being discussed.          Q  It's your statement from this podium that no discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that the option has not been presented to him.          MS. MYERS:  That is correct.          Q  Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?          MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have nothing to add to what's already been said.          Q  Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made so that it would be less regressive?          MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what might happen if.          Q  But do you stand by the previous conversations in February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said you'd exclude food and energy --          MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific structure of a decision that hasn't been made.          Q  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working groups?          MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --          Q  Could you check for us, because that's a real important credibility question?          MS. MYERS:  Sure.          Q  Since the task force was brought together this issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?          MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to add.          Q  Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading us.          MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.          Q  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --          MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about this issue.          Q  All we were trying to find out --          MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out and I've given you the answers, Helen.          Q  We're trying to find out what changed -- what made it an option again.  That's the --          MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.            Q  Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?          MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously considering and the President has not made a decision on.          Q  Yes, but he took it off the table in February.          MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.          Q  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off the table?          MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.           Q  Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change his mind?          MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.          Q  Did he change his mind?          MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on this we'll let you know.          Q  So he must have changed his mind, right?          MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean, --          Q  Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority exceeds the President's.          MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad mandate to look at all options; they've done that.          Q  Are you going to put out his income tax?          MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be available.           Q  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through it?          MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you through the questions.          Q  We're used to be walked line-by-line through the presidential tax forms.          MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)          Q  Could we have one?          MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer your questions about it.          Q  Did they file a joint form?          MS. MYERS:  Yes.          Q  When did he file it?          MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.          Q  Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for Miyazawa?          MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the meeting.          Q  No backgrounder today?          MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.          Q  This is complicated stuff.  We need help.  (Laughter.)          MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)          Q  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your thinking on whether or not to change your approach?          MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --          Q  But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they people whose opinions would carry weight with you?          MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia, although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, which we've been saying regularly.          Q  One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?          MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them every day.          Q  Which doesn't work so --          MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.  We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on the 26th.            Q  You say it's having an effect -- can you give us any documentation?          MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.          Q  There's been no -- you have not been able to provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.          MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if you'd like.          Q  We would like to hear from someone who can show us what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you provide something along those lines?          MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.          Q  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced this morning -- where is that money coming from?          MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the details of that package.          Q  So that would be new money that you would hope to get?          MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.          Q  Isn't there a concern, though, about offering something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.          MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do something immediately, which required money that was already approved in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to work with Congress to make that happen.          Q  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by Congress?          MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of conversations with members and will continue to work with them as this process moves forward.          Q  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through Congress?          MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with Congress.          Q  In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?          MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help give kids something to do.          Q  Who are they?          MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union of Police Associations.          Q  Will the FBI chief be there?          MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.          Q  Or any other federal law enforcement officials?          MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these national law enforcement organization leaders.          Q  Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?          MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.          Q  So this would be the $700 million that's in the budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?          MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700 million already in the budget.          Q  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or Fiscal '94 --          MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.          Q  This $1.8 billion on top of --          MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.          Q  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was calling Bob Dole?          MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?          MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.          Q  Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the other night, the satellite and all of this relationship.Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these Chambers of Commerce?          MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)  After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on this and other initiatives.          Q  What's the status of the President thinking about going to this Democratic retreat?          MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost certainly go.          Q  All three days?          MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be there yet.            Q  Is it open to coverage?          MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.          Q  Is he going to have any kind of address, statement, anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?          MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or what --          Q  Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?          MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it out.          Q  What about an AIDS czar?          MS. MYERS:  It's coming.          Q  Anything on the weekend?          Q  There's been a suggestion that he's going to this retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear or have any involvement in the gay rights march.          MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic retreat.          Q  The weekend?          MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on right now is the radio address on Saturday.          Q  Any travel plans?          MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.          Q  He's not going to be off campaigning for his stimulus package?          MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.          Q  What about mid-week?  Anything likely?          MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.          Q  Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?          MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.          Q  Going to name a drug czar this weekend?          MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.          Q  And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going to be focused on the stimulus package?          MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.          THE PRESS:  Thank you.

EDT     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, two months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our national deficit and to increase our investment in the American people, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget plan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in the country.            Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed the House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate.           All of these members of Congress know it's time to get the economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  Unfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working the will of the majority on the jobs bill.          When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every state and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue is not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking for full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't care about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying the rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their families and drawing a paycheck.          They're asking those of us who have the privilege of serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our economy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs plan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet national needs.            Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what size package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of the American people.           But even as we make those reductions and the package will be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the minds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the dramatic rise in violent crime.           So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an additional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the fiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a matching effort by local governments, this could put as many as 10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in communities all across our nation.          At a time when too many of our people live in fear of violent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their homes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments America can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.            I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no mistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I ever have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight for their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.          I want to thank the police officers who are here today and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here that I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to rehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the summer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to talk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country to have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and a brighter and more peaceful future.          I say what I say today not just because it's good for law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in these communities.  I have always supported community policing not only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, but because it cements better relationships between people in law enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.          These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  I promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four years.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind the core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.            So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the jobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if you will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will create real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my part now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.            I want now to give the people who are here with me on the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the American people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished Attorney General.            *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *           Q  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over the suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional dialogue?          THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --they wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, I made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's a lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden of the present system on many of our major employers, particularly many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the strength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general tax.          Q  Do you personally believe that the American public is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I mean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --          THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I will say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the benefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you streamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or over-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive care in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows absolutely massive savings to the health care system.          The real question is whether you can transfer those savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I have no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is the polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, they say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an affordable health care system.          But I don't think that has anything to do with this stimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first and foremost.  They want that more than anything else.          Q  Now that you've announced your willingness to compromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of your package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer jobs is one.          THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the highway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let me say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime bill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a supplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think we need to do that.          I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people with AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be done.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the safety of the public depends on that.            There are a number of other things that I don't -- I don't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator Mitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole called me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call him back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we discussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said that I would not make any statements about any specifics until at least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could reach some accord.            So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been already, and let's see if they can talk it out.          Q  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator Mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 million, that you want that as part of the package?          THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word for Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator Dole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  But I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I wanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the American people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly consistent with that.          Thank you.                                 END3:12 P.M. EDT

Really, the only people this is going to benefit, arethose who live in the cities where the train stops.  Who wants to driveto the train station from X (Lubbock for example)?  It's probably fartherto drive to the train station than it is to the nearest national airport.I really can't see spending 5.7 billion on a system that only three citieswill benefit from.

Ipser, Jr., 1993>Here's my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser's list10.  It's about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the     military.  Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not     revolve around them, and that one of the things they're out there defending     is our right to be critical of them, even denounce them.9.   Let me explain something to you.  Environmental policy and industrial     policy MUST go hand in hand.  Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years.     Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL! We     must have active government support of the key industries such as,     telecommunications, microelectronics, medical, biotech, and environmental     tech.  Meanwhile weed out old, inneficient, high-polution, industries     that are better left to other nations.  This will make us richer, help     produce new jobs, and help the environment.  To give credit where credit     is due, I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry (D-MA)     tonite.  In addition, it's time we get really, really serious about      issues like overpopulation, globabl warming, and ozone depletion.  The     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority!8.   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work,     to provide the services that people need, and to help solve the problems     that need to be solved.  Granted, some things can probably be done more     efficiently for less money, and should be.  But some things are going to     cost more money and I'm sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about     taxes all the time.  You want to live in my country, you pay your fair     share!7.   I can't believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes.  If you're     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an     enemy which at best doesn't affect us and at worst really should be our     friend, then you have no right to tell me you shouldn't pay taxes!6.   Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60's-esque touch!5.   Look, Canada, Europe, and Japan manage to provide health care for their     citizens (and, yes, basic health IS a human right which people are     entitled to).  If these nations aren't capitalist enough for you, then     I guess we've found something better than capitalism!  There is nothing     sacred about the capitalist system, and if something, be it socialism     or anything else, works better, then I say let capitalism die.4.   Make love, not War!3.   Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be a male and a feminist     at the same time.  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong, and trying to force     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse.  Women certainly      have as much to offer this world as men, and the day that gender     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of     the past few centuries seem like reform bills.  I look forward to it.2.   See number 10.1.   HEY MAN, ACADAMIA RULES!!            -Amar Chaudhary     Peace, Land, at Matzoh!

B2:    Male sex survey: Gay activity low    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough    examination of American men's sexual practices published since    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and    1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.    The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday    by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than    the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional    wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson,and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent thathomosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the generalmale population.

Even across the street, they may not display pictures of dead fetuses   or sing or chant loud enough to be heard by patients inside the clinic.

From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993.  P. A1.  EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer  SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as 12,000 people.  Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American, right-wing and what they called "pinko" organizations.  Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking any laws.  Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.  People who were subjects of the spy operation included former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who is based in South Africa.  Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and organizations was sold separately to the South African government.  In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify the search warrant.  The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than 25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not be reached for comment, his office said.  Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.  The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws. League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an employee and have said they simply traded information with police departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.  But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches, San Francisco police alleged that "ADL employees were apparently less than truthful" in providing information during an earlier search conducted without a warrant.  David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said the organization has not violated the law.  "There is nothing nefarious about how we operate or what we have done," he said.  "Our record speaks for itself."  The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret fund used to pay for "fact-finding operations."  Lehrer, according to the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L. Patterson.  An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.  Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as "Skins" and "Pinkos," but that did not necessarily mean that they were under surveillance.  "I might never see or call up on 99% of them again," Bullock said. "And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under, say, 'Pinko.'"  In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he was questioned by the FBI in the case.  A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses, vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license photographs.  Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and Bullock also provided information to the South African government, receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.  The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss nature of the spy operation.  The file notes that Kraft's articles "appear frequently in The Times and are well researched and written," but little else about the file is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal information.  Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his own paid informants under code names such as "Scott" and "Scumbag."  He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast, exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington, Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may have come from Los Angeles police officers.    From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.  ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.  SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential police information on citizens and groups.  But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax violations and conspiracy.  Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful about its spying operations, which collected information on more than 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political spectrum.  Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept files on political figures.  Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when deciding what charges to file.  In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H. Foxman described the ADL as "a Jewish defense agency which has fought to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80 years."  Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing information to police, journalists, academics, government officials and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain information illegally, he said.  "Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or identity of any source of information," Foxman said.  The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than "a private individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'"  Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.  "Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be distanced from ADL," Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator. Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.  Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.  A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants, produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.  "The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us," the district attorney said. -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI                                                TV made me do it! arens@isi.edujs

EDT               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.            Q  Could we do this on the lawn?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let's go out to the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President.          Q  Is the stimulus package dead?           MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.            Q  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You said it was a good visit, but no compromise.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk with Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there were no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as well.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not speak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the President was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close of that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the President about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked about that yesterday afternoon.          At the close of that discussion they said that they would have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator was up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific compromises made on either side, they did say that they would continue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.          Q  Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are both making concessions?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that phase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said consistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  He believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to take adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to make those adjustments.          Q  On the subject of a VAT --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.          Q  Can we stay on this for one more minute?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.          Q  We have a problem with the five minutes --          Q  I know no decisions have been made, but what would lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go down that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said this morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked at.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been made.          Q  To follow, have they done that directly through him?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President about it?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the VAT.  But the President has not made a decision.          Q  At the meetings that he's had with his own task force advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the possible options would be?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been presented for a decision, no.          Q  Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an option?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of briefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the President as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.            Q  You're not saying he didn't know it was being considered, though, are you?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.          Q  He knew that.          Q  But has he discussed that with his advisers?  That's what I'm asking.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being considered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been over the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I don't even know that it's --          Q  But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at this stage?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is considered --           Q  Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed it.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just repeated.           Q  George, is there any concern here that as a result of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if it were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out the way it did, that there may now be the development of a credibility gap on this issue and others?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is now public knowledge that this is being considered.          Q  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it was off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it come out not from you people, but --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out from the administration.  What are you talking about?          Q  What I'm saying is, though, that the President said he would let us know.           MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.          Q  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that it's not going to be on the program.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.          Q  On March 25th.           MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.          Q  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out by rooting around in the fine print of an interview          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do a very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is --(laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the Clinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right here, and AP story -- "Clinton wants more money for spying."          Q  What about his remark that if it were being considered, he'd tell us about it?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned, and he'd let you know.          Q  And did he?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say this morning?          Q  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of me.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of Health of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his administration.  That is his administration policy.          Q  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they orchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they answered the questions.          Q  You're saying here that it didn't have to be dragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were considering it.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.  Painfully clear.          Q  Was there a particular political strategy in making it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax day?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being considered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they answered that it was being considered.          Q  George, The New York Times --          Q  Why do it yesterday?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.          Q  The New York Times reports today that Secretary Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill, but which turned out to be totally false.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally false, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they say that.           Q  The question is, is the President concerned about behavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he doing about it, if so?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a mistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the matter.          Q  Isn't that the same information that goes to the President?          Q  If I could go back to the stimulus package --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of information.  I think that's where the confusion was.          Q  When did you all first learn about this mistake that was made?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.          Q  And as far as you know, is the President aware of it?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.          Q  And was he aware of it before he read about it in The New York Times?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.          Q  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?  Anything?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.          Q  Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on this for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both statements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that mixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said it was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.          Q  Did they drop it -- is this something that you choose to spin or make an issue of?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of work, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to get this jobs package going.          Q  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a minute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an amendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in the conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no changes in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the timing like that.          Q  Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer this week than you were last week?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going to pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make adjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the votes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's going to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.          Q  Has there been any indication that this situation has changed?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on it.  We'll know when the votes are taken.          Q  George, last week you said that there are -- or various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go through Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because he was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could accept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted to talk to the President about the stimulus package.          Q  He initiated the conversation?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You say he's making --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly what he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, and the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President doesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get it through, he will.          Q  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before the actual vote.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.          Q  Today?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will happen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward with some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it passed.          Q  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you tonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase is.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how detailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the package last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday afternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today in the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator Dole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific compromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.  And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.          Q  What are the follow-up discussions if not the President and Dole?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going to talk to Senator Dole.          Q  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)          Q  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, how about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the President, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation in that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.          Q  Did they discuss actual numbers?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they talked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked about the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the level of this many x-billion dollars.           Q  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a package?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.          Q  Did the White House have anything to do with the protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole was speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.          Q  And has the President been in touch with Senators Kohl or Feingold?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them, no.          Q  George, is the President considering the more palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves having to pay for the have-nots?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that the tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his budget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your question, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.          Q  George, on the subject of accuracy in information, you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is not true.  It's actually waste water money.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for Wisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee.           Q  But it would not affect the drinking water problem because it's waste water money, right?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment overall.           Q  But the implication from your statement the other day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  Would you agree that's not the case?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.          Q  A leftover question from this morning, which was, when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating on a VAT?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just don't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.            Q  So sometime since March 25th?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know the exact date.          Q  George, the President this morning mentioned that some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax being okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed, or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already proposed?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to say about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is being considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.  The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that.           Q  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't be to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the income tax, for instance?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on that.          Q  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, Senator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you think -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it have a chance?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea.           Q  Is that a consideration whether you all put it forward?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration if the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration now.          Q  You said at the beginning of the briefing that circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under consideration.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to this morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something that has to be considered.          Q  Those are the circumstances that have changed?  That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled it out that groups have asked it to be considered?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said.           Q  Is that true?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the deliberations.          Q  But, George --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as the President said, groups came forward and said this is something you ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it.           Q  Is that the only thing that's changed since his prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  Can you explain how those groups -- how that information got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading the newspaper or did groups make presentations?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know, the health care task force has met with dozens of groups.          Q  But this is the President's knowledge that these groups had come forward.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what was coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been published positions in the newspapers.          Q  Have certain groups briefed him on the group's presentations to them?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him -- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these groups.          Q  What kind of arguments did the groups make that were persuasive enough that the President would change the position that he had enunciated previously?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance health care.          Q  The President wasn't aware of those longstanding positions?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.  Obviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the basic arguments for and against a VAT tax.          Q  What we're trying to figure out here -- you're telling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February and now --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't necessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.          Q  I know, but the President said that it was off the table.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's changed is the positions of these groups, except you're also describing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.  If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been made to the President --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the presentations to the health care task force.          Q  There's no relationship at all between the fact that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he favored will not produce enough revenue to finance --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested that they would produce all the revenue.          Q  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were appropriate ways to finance health care.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that he said anything to refute that.          Q  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind of core benefits --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task force ever suggested that there would.          Q  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his programs?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical situation.            Q  But does that promise -- would that promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him from seeking a VAT tax?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions on the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the implications then.          Q  Which specific groups can you cite -- business, labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task force has prompted this consideration?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just don't have that.          Q  George, can you tell us to what extend these other alternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or other financing options are also still on the table and what these options are?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force and representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking at a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that there are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not going to comment --          Q  What's the scope --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on them, no.          Q  What's the scope of the need?  How much are you talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task force is looking at.          Q  Since there's not going to be any briefing on the Miyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the President hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and the remark about market access at the press conference?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?          Q  Does no mean yes.          Q  Yes and no.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when he was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the President.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and the U.S. that we want to do something about.          Q  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in terms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit very clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your characterization of the Prime Minister's comments.          Q     that we need specific export targets, specific numerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with Miyazawa?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad discussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into those specifics until after the meeting.          Q  Why?          Q   That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or not -- does the President believe that without specific numerical targets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of hopeless that this is going to change very much?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not want to get into the specifics of how that would be done.          Q  But does the President believe that their stimulus package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister Miyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.          Q  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to be some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary Christopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do more, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to work with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to press for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I think that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral packages.          Q  Do you think the Japanese need to do more?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work with all our allies to do as much as we can.          Q  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on the Bosnia policy.  And he said, "It's a rather emotional response."       MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.          Q  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White  House condone that kind of remark?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary Christopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find answers for.           Q  But that specific -- "rather emotional response" -- specific term?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.          Q  In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?          Q  To take stronger action, to take military action -- air strikes, anything that can be done?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what must be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as you know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms embargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase pressure at this time.          Q  What is your response to the critics who would say that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain the presidency?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard for increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the arms embargo.          Q  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen getting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said that military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that change your thinking?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to say.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions and talking about the arms embargo.          Q  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She said she would be able to provide some administration officials who could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are you going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.          Q  That's exactly what she said.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of evidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have an effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute, what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact effect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods into Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't know.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at all, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.          Q  Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be released?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.  And it will be probably later today.          Q  Is the President considering signing an executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work force as part of the gay rights march here next week?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal for that at this time, not that I know of.          Q  It's something that the President promised during the campaign that he would do.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't think it's anything that's on his plate right now.          Q  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point on this issue?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.  I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian community sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of different groups and communities.          Q  Do you know if that's scheduled --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.          Q  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)          Q  It's a good thing you asked.          Q  Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.          Q  How long --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.          Q  Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?  (Laughter.)          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.          Q  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major speech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but I think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not exactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like that.          Q  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific timing of something like that, but it's certainly something under discussion and something we've been working on.          Q  Campaign finance reform?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.          Q  Do you think it will be next week?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.          Q  The biodiversity treaty is something you're working on?  I missed the question.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.  He asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working on.          Q  Do you know what organizations might be represented in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.          Q  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out of town on the day of the march?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate meeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston on Sunday, as he did last year.          Q  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you on the question?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?          Q  On the gays.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the President's schedule for the day, certainly.          Q?    George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is that Sunday?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.          Q  And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one day?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how long the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't know.          Q  You would have made the gay meeting public, right?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting -- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you about it.          Q  I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --       MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in the Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's not, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)          Q     at the White House in the Bush administration gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White House had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make sure --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do anything like that.          Q  Certainly not.          Q  What marching orders did the President give to General Vessey?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for about half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.  The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes in our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look into investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on remains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to military archives.            And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the activities of the joint commission and on the document.          Q  Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis at this stage?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the Vietnamese.          Q  A number of Defense officials have been saying that they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact, non-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to as Americans from time to time.  Do people --           MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final determination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we have it, we'll make a judgment.          Q  I know you don't have any final determination, but given all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that that's a likely possibility?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't want to characterize it in any way until the review is complete.          Q  George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech in Boston?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.           Q  Is the President going to have a press conference tomorrow with Miyazawa?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I'm not positive.  Yes, I expect, yes.          Q  Was Toon in with Vessey?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.           Q  He was in on the meeting?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  What was the question?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey, and the answer is yes.           Q  Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal report this morning the President's distressed about some of his press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied that the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than any of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --          Q  How many questions?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 occasions.          Q  How many were while he was jogging?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very good question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the article also implied that these questions were only answered at tightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.  He's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to questions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --          Q  Oval Office press conference -- when was that?           MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the --East Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval Office, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the Roosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington Press Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local television anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The Portland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. He's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and Connecticut --          Q  Can you address the question of the attitude?  The article implies that he doesn't --          Q  Why doesn't he like us?  (Laughter.)          Q  Did you really get blamed for that Post story?          Q  The story is that you -- are you held responsible for it.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment about this.          Q  Are you denying that the President has shown displeasure publicly?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the discussions between the President and myself.          Q  Did the President write that letter to Chris Webber?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?          Q  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball player?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.          Q  That is an authentic letter?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  Since the President first talked about the VAT in February, he said at the time that he thought there probably should be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.  Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a proposal he hasn't made.          Q  George, does the President have some agenda for this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about including AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.          Q  The military issue?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.          Q  Is he using this event to name the AIDS --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.          Q  George, what specifically is the President doing to prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had general discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the Trade Representative and others.          Q     report yet?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report referred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him today.          Q  He was?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  Does he intend to use any of these instances that --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the report's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.          Q  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was that there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he feels that way?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the record in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again, I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The thrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the President may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he has the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent history.     Q  Can we come up to your office?  (Laughter.)     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If you're invited.            THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                 END                    1:34 P.M.

Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders -    usually 13 - and they're using more LSD and inhalants like glue    and air fresheners, says a new survey.    The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds    "statistically significant increases" in eighth-graders' use of    many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, LSD and inhalants.    "We may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing    drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters    adolescence," says Lloyd Johnston, University of Michigan, chief    researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and    Human Services.    But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long    decline.    The study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the    following in the 30 days before they were polled:        * 8th-graders  - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%;                         cocaine 0.7%.        * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%;                         cocaine 0.7%.        * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%;                         cocaine 1.3%.    Among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants    declined over the year before.  Not so with LSD.    * 2% of eighth-graders have tried LSD in the last year, up 24%    over 1991.     * Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6%    tried it in the last year.    Reducing drug use among students "requires a different kind of    strategy" that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part    of an overall illness prevention plan.    The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders    disapprove of them.    "It's scary," Shalala says.  "Dealers are focusing on younger, more    vulnerable kids."Scott Kennedy,  Brewer and PatriotBefore:  "David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets          the Bible through the barrel of a gun..."  --ATF spokesmanAfter:   "[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets          [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun..."  --Me

Not!Organization: Oklahoma State University, Computer Science, StillwaterKeywords: drugs DEA WOD legalizationLines: 140The DEA and other organizations would have the American peoplebelieve that we are winning the "war on drugs".  I'm going todispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showingyou the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertionsI've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearlydemonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on therise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drugabuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The realityis, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything,substance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply apossible solution to this problem.The following text is an excerpt from an article about rock musicand pot entitled "Hello Again, Mary Jane" which appears in thecurrent issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).    Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing    smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  "Perhaps    because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby    is out in full force," says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug    Enforcement Administration.  "The fact is, they're losing the    battle."  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said    they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner    says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that    studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of    nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.The chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993issue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders" by MikeSnider, p. 6D).

I think you can see that oneof the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression thatthe "war on drugs" is being won is to selectively quote statistics---only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gonedown.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post isan excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt todeceive the public.Usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the sametime usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution).Also, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone downbut drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore,if one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all*the statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called "war on drugs" isbeing lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugsgo, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants,then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placedin its true perspective.For those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then trydrinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell methat it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal*drugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitlessattempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch toanother drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be tolegalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to bewithin reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a fewtimes) and then couple this with a massive drug education program.The reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution isbecause people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite thegovernment's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on druginterdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drugeducation).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime becausethe profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which oftengoes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact thataddicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for theirmoney and posessions in order to support their expensive habit;legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fallsubstantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.IMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has beendone to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try toemploy heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarceratingthem.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less thanthey used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been broughtabout by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people canlight up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco inorder to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methodsbe used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carriedout.  They are as follows:    * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which      states the possible health hazzards involved with using this      product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.      Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used      ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.    * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of      revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs      through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from      drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law      enforcement.    * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of      18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the      taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.      Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning      information should also be a felony.    * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the      purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This      agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad      drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.I'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article havebeen hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thoughtit was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...)all at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand onWOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in itthat you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW,I posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove myassertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths---something which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.Scott Kennedy,  Brewer and PatriotBefore:  "David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets          the Bible through the barrel of a gun..."  --ATF spokesmanAfter:   "[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets          [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun..."  --Me
From: kennejs@a.cs.okstate.edu (KENNEDY JAMES SCOT)Subject: Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eighth-gradersOrganization: Oklahoma State University, Computer Science, StillwaterKeywords: youths drugs LSD inhalantsLines: 87The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993issue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up Among U.S. eighth-graders" by MikeSnider, p. 6D).    A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are    using them and fewer deem drug use as risky.     For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results    from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is    being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by    eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students    nationwide.    Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If    drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will    have fewer "drug-using contemporaries" who act as examples of    substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,    one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths "must be given    the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,"    Johnston says.    This type of resurgence "is possible," says Eileen Shiff, author of    "Experts Advise Parents" (Delta, $14.95).  But that's not the issue,    she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today    could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.    Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with    drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to    their children.  "I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer" to    their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,    Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, "lock-in" party where    no booze or drugs were allowed.  "We need to fulfill that parental    role, otherwise the peer group takes over," she says.    Officials may "talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't    done anything that I've seen," says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,    Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and    other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a    member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says "there's always going to be    experimentation" with drugs.    A real war on drugs could be waged "education-wise," she says.  But    "some don't want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give    them ideas; it's the same with birth control.  I think you should    give the kids the information or have it accessible" through classes,    pamphlets and speakers, she says.    Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in    kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,    Fla.  "I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think    kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds    (about using drugs)," he says.    Scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working; only    one commercial has gotten it right, he says.  The commercial opens    with two "good-looking girls" in the restroom talking about having    no prom date.  Then they take a hit off a joint.  "That hits home    because it's not attractive," he says.  "You can't be doing drugs if    you want somebody to like you."

In addition, it requirs anyonewith a used car dealer's license to own at least 10 cars at a time, all thetime. Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's questions.Steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resellcars.  Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bumpup against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but thesestupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pullingyourself up.  So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willingto take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you'reprotected from doing what you want with your life.Here's what I see libertarianism offering you:Your money is truly yours; it belongs to you.  You can use it to buy a car.If you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you.  Youcan use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sellthat car.Your life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someonethinks that it's "wrong" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 monthsrather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life ortheir money, it is your life and your money.My money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car.Perhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewheredissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.That someone could go to the government and insist that the government makeus stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doingwhat we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression.And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decencyand common sense.  A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty.And yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving orrejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike meas a wonderful way to improve the human condition.   Thanks awfully,             Patrick

After much debate the new Governor Bradfordprivitized the land; assigning plots to each family.  According to PerryD. Westbrook:  "The change was immediately justified by the increasedindustry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted."Bradford himself acknowledged this failure of communism.  He wrote:  "Theexperience that was had in this common course and condition, triedsundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince thevanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some oflater times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community intoa commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiserthan God.  For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed muchconfusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have beento their benefit and comfort."Bradford did not blame this failure on the "strangers", but on the basicselfishness in all men.  He wrote "seeing all men have this corruption inthem, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them."  In otherwords, according to Westbrook, "Bradford found private enterprise to bethe most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state."Let's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.

AsI've noted before, I'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of eliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers,barbers, etc.  One need not, however, swallow the entire libertarianagenda to accomplish this end.  Just because one grants the benefits ofallowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services withoutregulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.  (As some/many libertarians would argue.)  On a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulationis obviously worthwhile.  The libertarian agenda, however, does not callfor this assessment.  It assumes that the costs of regulation (of anykind) always outweigh its benefits.  This approach avoids all sorts of difficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic, to say the least.I have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education, national defense or local police that suggests a "free market" can providea more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectivesthan is provided through "statist" approaches.   With some notableexceptions, however, I do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile analysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians.  jsh--Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   "One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

(Don't think I'm going to say, "spend it to educate people", because I know plenty of educated dopers).  Actually, spend it on  things like drug treatment programs.I saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually prescribe and addict his "recommended" dosage, and try to ween him off from it,or cut the amount down to levels where it is "acceptable".  Sounds good so far from what I heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out the dealer's markets, etc. (But that was the only thing I have heard about it.)However, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be bought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD.The 60 Minute Report said it worked with "cocaine" cigarettes, pot and heroin.Ryan

(Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city willnever attend a single performance there, so they might feel differentlyabout having to help pay for it.)However, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient togive government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact,we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech preciselybecause it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as otherissues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on thesidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide justwhether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speechshould be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You canimagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majorityon a case-by-case basis.Not so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactlywhat they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on acase-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on acase-by-case basis.There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring withfree enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having agovernment that interferes with free enterprise in an "efficient"manner; I call it political market failure.Thus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have toswallow the "whole libertarian agenda."Roger Collins

Due to rounding, the 1991 est. for LSD could be anywherefrom .550 to .649 and the 1992 est. could be anywhere from .850 to .949.This means that the actual change (if you believe these statistics in thefirst place) was anywhere from 31% to 73%.

(I won't necessarily defend himon other issues.)  There were NEVER any specific projects included in the CommunityDevelopment Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  CongressionalRepublicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected whatthey felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus packagewas ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure theWhite House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submittedto Congress.  It didn't work.)The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere closeto covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If itwere passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund andat what level.In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one everexpected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUSPACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus package for ALL projects.  The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing constructionand remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there areplaces where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near thebottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 millionor so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressingpriorities.If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projectsthat will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clintonadministration has been publicizing the issue.A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It isworth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to themis new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending,arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spendingpriorities than "Washington bureaucrats."  Is it clear now?  Or is this all too complicated to understand?jsh--Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   "One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

One that I have held for sometime.  We do notallow people to develop on the paths that they choose or desire.  Even withheterosexuals we tend to leave some hanging in the sense of knowledge andinformation about sexuality and relationships.It is very difficult for a young person to develop and build a positiveview of themself when they are constantly being told implicitly and explicitlythat they are wrong and immoral. The concepts about personal relationships are deeply embedded in emotionalismand fear- these fears cover a wide range, but mostly jealousy and lack of trustseem to be cornerstones of modern day American relationships.  We also set ontop of this the concepts of Madison Avenue attractiveness and standards and putthe pressure on to measure up.

Would you admit to having had sex with other people at some considered abnormalrate (this applies to heterosexual men).  In fact, as one gay man and onestraight man put it, "men lie about the number of partners, because that'sthe thing to do"- our culture for the male almost requires this type ofresponse.  It may seem harmless and silly, but carries a large emotionaland mental price tag.I hear college male students everyday talking about their 'supposed' conquest.  They just have to look good to one another, at least in theireyes.  But also know that alot of this does go on, there are many collegemales (hetero) having a lot of sex with different partners.

Too bad it'sso demonstrably false.  Take a look at Great Britain sometime for a nice history on drug criminalization.  The evidence there shows thatduring periods of time when drugs (such as heroin) were illegal, crimewent up and people did die from bad drugs.  During times when drugswere legalized, those trends were reversed.>>If you would like to prove how clueless you are, we can get into>why - again a lot of wasted posts that I don't think this group>was intended for and something easily solved by you doing a little>research.Now this is a great example of an ironclad proof.  Gosh, I'm convinced.( :-} for the humor impaired).  First, assert something for which youhave no evidence, then dodge requests for proof by claiming to knowwhat this group was intended for.  As to research, if you'd done anyat all, you'd realize that there is plenty of reason to believe thatlegalizing drugs will have many benefits to society.  There are someplausible arguments against it, too, but they aren't enough to convinceme that criminalization of drugs is the answer.
